# Props

Props are items the Hero did not pay xp for. It is the
GM's sworn duty to destroy or remove these items
from the Hero's possession.

* The Hero must pay a point of Favor to activate
a prop for the session. For the session the Hero
acquires the prop, it is considered active.
* If a Hero looses a prop in the same session he
acquired it he gains a point of Favor.
Props act like Gear Boons in most respects but are
only usable once per scene. Many props have further
limits:
* Slow Burn — Every use degrades them one
level.
* One Shot — One use and they are gone
* Session — Only usable once per session

#### Sacrifice

Character's can always sacrifice Props for some
advantage.

* Absorb Damage as if it was a boon
* Act as a Boon even if the prop itself is
unrelated. The player is responsible for
narrating this so that the loss of the prop
provides an advantage.
