# Play

With a world and  a bunch of Heroes, at some point players are going to
disagree about what happens in the imaginary world.  That's why the 
Demiurges invented dice.

## Exploration & Action

The default mode of play is exploration and action, which describes 
the state where Heroes are exploring the world and taking simple 
actions that are either well within their capabilities, or which have
only one interesting outcome. 

There don't need to be any heavy rules for ths, simply some people 
telling a story together where narrative authority is passed around 
by mutual consent and no one has to ask who's holding the talking 
shell. 

In traditional RPGs this relies heavily on the GM to define the 
imaginary world and actions of NPCs and players to define the 
background, actions and words of their characters.  How closely
your group adheres to this model is a decision for your group, and 
not specified in these rules. 

When mutual consent is insufficient to decide an outcome, a 
[Challenge](challenge.md) results.
