# Keys

Each Hero begins with one key and can have a
maximum of 5 keys. Buying a new key costs 1 xp.

Fulfilling the requirement of the Key, or `Hitting the
Key`, grants the Hero 1 Favor. A single Key can not be

Hit more than 3 times per session.
Keys also have buyoff conditions. If the Hero fulfills
this condition and the player chooses, he can buyoff
the Key. Buying off the key grants 3 Favor, but the
Hero can not purchase that Key again unless it
represents a different relationship/belief/etc.

For example if a priest has the Key of Faith and he
renounces his faith and he chooses to buys off the key.
He could not buy the Key of Faith again for that
religion. Heâ€™d need to convert to different religion
before he could buy the Key of Faith again.

Sample Keys:

**Key of Faith**

* Hitting the Key: Convert someone, defend
your faith even in the face of harm.
* Buyoff: Renounce your Faith

**Key of Love**

* Hitting the Key: Make a decision influenced
by the person you love, defend the person
you love at risk to yourself.
* Buyoff: Sever the relationship with the
person you love.

**Key of the Revolutionary**

* Hitting the Key: You put yourself at risk
opposing the status quo.
* Buyoff: Accept favors from the rulers for
your support/action/inaction.

A full list of keys is included in the appendix. New
Keys can be created if required. Acceptable Keys will
drive a Hero to an overt action or cause them to
interact with the creation (or creation to interact with
them). Wholly internal or reactive matters, such a
brave may be Boons or Secrets, but they are not Keys.
Unless an ideal represents a path that forces the Hero
to take action, it is unlikely to qualify as a Key of the
Ideal/Belief.
