# Finishing Touches

## Questions

### How is Your Hero a Badass?

What is it about the Hero defies explanation. Do
they just keep coming no matter what kind of beating
they took or do they have a simply uncanny situational
awareness? What is it about the Hero that defines, not
in what situation they is a badass, but how, in that
situation, they are a badass.

Many people are good in a fight or debate, what we
want to know is how your Hero is good. What do the
Hero’s opponents ascribe their frustration to?

### What Does Your Hero Need to Accomplish?

What is your Hero’s goal? What are they driven to do?
Again interesting goals make fun Heroes. This can be
a long term goal or short term goal. If it is short term,
make sure it leads to the next goal or your Hero may
lose the spotlight.



### What Just Happened?

Something just happened to knock over your Hero’s
comfortable ant hill, what was it? This should be
something that the Hero doesn’t have the luxury of
ignoring. It doesn’t have to be explained or something
that is tied deeply into the Hero it just has to be
something to start the game off with a banger.
