# Attributes

Each hero is a balance of **Power**, **Precision** and **Possibility**.
They are strong in one, and weak in another.  This is all in 
comparison to their other attributes.

**Assign a d12, a d10 and a d8. One die to each attribute.**
Your dominant attribute will have a profound effect
on the narration of your Hero.

## Power

**Power** governs the application of solid unyielding
force. *Big swords*, *Fireballs*, *Force Fields*, the *BFG-9000*,
*Tough as Nails* and *Iron Will* are all examples of Boons
usually associated with the power attribute.

Not all power is physical, a preacher's charisma or a 
politician's control over the state bureaucracy can be just
as much unyielding power as any set of power armor.

Power is by far the most important attribute.

## Precision

**Precision** governs application of finesse and accuracy. *Sniper Scope*, 
*Unerring Aim*, 
*Move Like Water*, 
*Pressure Points* and *Rapier* are all
examples of Boons often associated with precision.

Precision is about applying small amounts of 
power very effectively.  An 
orbital death laser is less effective than a rubber chicken, 
if you can't make it hit your target.

Precision is by far the most important attribute.

## Possibility

**Possibility** governs creating, spotting and
exploiting opportunities. *Feint*, *Trip*, *Google Research*, *Sense
Weakness* and *Mirror Scrying* are examples of possibility
related Boons.

Possibility is about spotting the opportunity to precisely 
apply power.  Without being able to see the opportunity, the 
*Sniper Rifle* collects dust on the shelf, and the villains run 
roughshod over the good people of the world.  

Possibility is by far the most important attribute.
