# Attributes

Each Hero has 3 attributes:

* Power
* Precision
* Possibility

Assign a d8, a d6 and a d4. One die to each attribute.
Your dominant attribute will have a profound effect
on the narration of your Hero.

**Power** governs the application of solid unyielding
force. Big swords, fireballs, force fields, the BFG-9000,
tough as nails and iron will are all examples of boons
usually associated with the power attribute.

**Precision** governs application of finesse. Move like
water, pressure points, telekinetic kill and rapier are all
examples of elements associated with precision.

The **Possibility** attribute governs creating, spotting and
exploiting opportunities. Feint, trip, research, sense
weakness and divination are examples of possibility
related boons.
