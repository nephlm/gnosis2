# Attributes

Each hero is a balance of **Power**, **Precision** and **Possibility**.
They are strong in one, and weak in another.  This is all in 
comparison to their other attributes.

**Assign a d12, a d10 and a d8. One die to each attribute.**
Your dominant attribute will have a profound effect
on the narration of your Hero.

## Power

**Power** governs the application of solid unyielding
force. Big swords, fireballs, force fields, the BFG-9000,
tough as nails and iron will are all examples of boons
usually associated with the power attribute.

Not all power is physical, a preacher's charisma or a 
politician's control over the state bureaucracy can be just
as much unyielding power as any set of power armor.

Power is by far the most important attribute.

## Precision

**Precision** governs application of finesse and accuracy. Sniper scopes, 
unerring aim, move like
water, pressure points and rapier are all
examples of boons often associated with precision.

Precision is about applying small amounts of 
power very effectively.  An 
orbital death laster is less effective than a rubber chicken, 
if you can't make it hit your target.

Precision is by far the most important attribute.

## Possibility

**Possibility** governs creating, spotting and
exploiting opportunities. Feint, trip, research, sense
weakness and divination are examples of possibility
related boons.

Possibility is about spotting the opportunity to precisely 
apply power.  Without being able to see the opportunity, the 
sniper rife collects dust on the shelf, and the villains run 
roughshod over the good people of the world.  

Possibility is by far the most important attribute.
