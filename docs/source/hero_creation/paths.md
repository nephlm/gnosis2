# Paths

Paths are Hero's way of being.  They are a balance between
a *nature* and a *role*.  

* Role the 
Hero fills in the story the group is creating.
    * The Path of the Thief or the 
    Path of the Believer fit into 
    this category.  
* What the 
Hero is. 
    * Path of the Artist or Path of Greed fit 
    into this category
* The Hero's position in the world.
    * Path of Membership or Path of the Commander fit
    into this category.

Many paths blur the line between the three categories.
Although many paths are listed, they are just examples.
Players and groups are encouraged to create their own 
paths that fit their own needs. Custom paths should 
force the Hero to interact with {{Creation}}, they should
never be purely internal.

When a Hero performs an act in furtherance of one of 
their paths they are considered to be **Walking the Path**.
The first three times a Hero walks each of their paths in
session, the Hero gains a {{Favor}}.

A Hero may also **Step off a Path** when they perform some
action counter to the path they can choose to remove the 
Path from the Hero and receive three {{Favor}}.

Lastly, at an appropriate moment, the Hero may **Complete the Path**.
Completion happens when the path has run its course and 
Hero chooses to shift their attention to something else.
A thief may make a score and choose to complete their 
Path of the Thief and focus on something else. 
The triggering event should be some sort of high point
along the path, which differentiates from Stepping off a Path.

When a Hero Completes a Path, they gain a new Path. 
Not all Paths have an obvious way they can be Completed.

**The Hero starts the game with 
one free path.  Additional paths can be acquired by 
spending 1xp.**

Sample Paths:

**Path of Faith**

The Hero is a pious believer and defender
of their faith.

* Walking the Path: Convert someone to the Hero's faith, 
defend the faith in the face of consequences.
* Stepping off the Path: Renounce the faith.

**Path of the Guardian**

There is someone important to the Hero
whom the Hero is sworn to defend 
and whose wellbeing the Hero
puts above their own safety.

* Walking the Path: Make a decision to 
safeguard the person instead of another 
course of action or the Hero puts themselves
at risk to ensure the safety of the person.
* Stepping off the Path: Choose not to protect the person.
* Completing the Path: The person 
(or someone who can) releases the Hero from 
their duty.

**Path of the Revolutionary**

The powers that be have done the Hero or their loved ones
wrong, and they will overthrow them or die
trying.

* Walking the Path: The Hero puts themselves at risk to oppose
the status quo.
* Stepping off the Path: Accept favors from the rulers for the Hero's
support/action/inaction on their behalf.
* Complete the Path: Overflow the rulers.
