# Talents

Talents are any ability which are wholly contained
within the Hero and can’t normally be taken away.
Talents are usually things like skills, aptitudes, spells,
etc.

#### Broad Talent

* Applicable to major contexts
* Examples: Fighting, Science, Beautiful, Mage,
Driving, Tough, etc.
* +1d
* Costs 3xp

#### Common Talent

* Applicable to a major field of study within a
context
* Examples: Sword Fighting, Physics, Intimidation,
Trial Lawyer
* +2d
* Costs 3 xp
* Requires a related Broad Talent

#### Master Talent

* Only applicable to a narrow range of situations
* Examples: Newtonian Physics, Quantum
Mechanics, Intimidating PhD students,
* Combat Maneuvers must have an actual
uncommon requirement to apply
    * Must be fighting multiple foes, must have
    just taken damage, immediately after taking
    out an opponent, etc
* If the character can use the Master Talent just as
often as a Common Talent it doesn’t qualify as a
Master Talent. In order to be a master talent,
the Hero’s player will have to take actions to
make it applicable, rather than the GM having to
take action make it inapplicable.
