# Boons

Boon is the general name for a host of abilities that
make the Hero more effective.  These are abilities the 
Hero pays xp for and in general can be permanently 
lost or taken.  Which is not to say they can't be
*temporarily* lost.

Whenever the Hero is trying to do something uncertain 
the player makes their **Attribute Roll** which consists 
rolling the die for each attribute and adding up the total.

* Boons allow the player to roll one or more attributes with 
some level of {{advantage}}.  
* Each attribute can have up to one boon during any given 
attribute.
* Boons do not stack on a single attribute.

The Boon is attached to a specific attribute based on 
the {{Strategy}} of the attribute roll, and has an
appropriate die size based on that attribute.  

Boons are not inherently tied to specific Attributes, 
but some Boons have clear pre-dispositions.  *Strong Arm*
is almost certainly going to be associated with Power, 
while depending on circumstances a *Sniper Rifle* could 
be used for the Power, Precision or Possibility die.

Boons come in four types: [](talents.md), [](gear.md), 
[](network.md) and 
[](location.md).


In Gnosis *Excalibur* and an *Orbital Death Laser* are equally 
impactful in most games where they might appear.  They are 
probably both tier 3 Boons in most games.  The key 
question is how effective they are in helping Heroes overcome
challenges.  






## Tiers

Boons are rated in tiers from 1-3 which corresponds to how 
many advantage dice are rolled with an attribute. 
No matter how many dice are rolled, only one die,
usually the highest, is used for each attribute. 

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1

* - Tier
  - Advantage Dice
* - Tier 1
  - +1 advantage die
* - Tier 2
  - +2 advantage dice
* - Tier 3
  - +3 advantage dice
```

Rolling a d12 with a tier 2 Boon would cause the player to roll
3d12 and choose the highest die.

Players may not start with tier 3 Boons and even after play they take 
work to acquire and usually only apply to narrow circumstances.

## Maximum Tier vs Effective Tier

The descriptions of Boons will discuss the criteria for a Boon being
of each tier, but this is the maximum possible tier for a given 
Boon, and Heroes may purchase a Boon at a lower tier than its
maximum, and for many types of Boons higher tier versions are bought 
on top of lower tier equivalents. 
A tier 2 Talent, *Doctor of Physics* is built on top
of its tier 1 equivalent, *University Professor*. 

Even for Boons that don't have this sort of hierarchy, 
a Boon can always be bought at less than its maximum potential, 
with the understanding that the Hero hasn't yet mastered its full
potential.

While *Excalibur* is tier 3 gear, that's really its 
maximum potential tier, while *Swords and Daggers* will 
never exceed tier 1.  



## Example


> When Talia was a young girl, she had no special skills
but got in a fight anyway. Her player made an attribute roll
which was a simply a d12+d10+d8 with no advantage.

Later she acquired a tier 2 *Magical Dagger*, but she 
only had 2xp so bought it as a regular *Dagger*.

> When she next gets into a fight her player uses her *Dagger* 
with her Precision attribute which is her d12, 
so her player rolls two d12s and chooses the highest 
one and adds it to her d10+d8.  If it had been a *Magical Warhammer*
it would likely have had to go with her Power attribute.

Much later she has a whole set of Boons to choose from, 
including full use of her *Magical Dagger*.
When in a fight her go to {{Strategy}} is tier 2 
*Magical Dagger*, tier 1 *Tough Skinned* and tier 1 
*Seams and Gaps*.

> At this point when her player rolls an attribute 
roll using this preferred Strategy, they roll
3d12 for Precision, 2d10 for Power and 2d8 for Possibility, 
and choose the highest d12, d10 and d8 from the roll
and add them up.
