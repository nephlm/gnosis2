# Network

A Hero’s network describes the people the Hero
knows and can turn to for hel Each member of the
Hero’s Network is a full NPC with a skill cascade
defined when they are purchased. The depth of the
cascade is determined by the level that the Contact is
purchased. Hero’s can use members of their Network
as Boons (add to attribute pools) when they are
present, agree to help and they have a relevant skill set.

Enemies are usually purchased as Talents rather than
part of the Hero’s Network. Character’s can buy
groups as part of their network but they still designate
an anchor who is their primary contact inside the
organization.

A player can spend xp and upgrade a Contact to an
Ally or an Ally to Companion during play. Heroes can
not acquire Contacts at character creation.
