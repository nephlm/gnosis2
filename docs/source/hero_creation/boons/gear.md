# Gear

This is an item that is part of the Hero’s story. This
doesn’t have to be hand held personal equipment,
vehicles and familiars also count. Stationary gear,
should probably be purchased as locations.

Getting any gear requires an in game opportunity to
acquire it. Gear is purchased with xp and so is part of
the Hero. The Hero can not be denied access to their
gear for prolonged period of time (much longer than a
scene) except for plot related reasons. Even then they
should be rewarded with Favor. These items can’t be
destroyed without replacement or compensation.

Gear can be purchased as a discreet item or as a
cascade. Generally speaking it is more advantageous to
buy a cascade but not all unique gear lends itself to a
cascade. A cascade is a set of boons representing a
description of the item at various levels.

For example the unique sword, Excalibur, can be
purchased as Unique: Excalibur (+3d), Rare: Magic
Sword (+2d) or Normal: Sword (+1d). A character
could buy a cascade which would include all three
boons for 6 points. This gives the character extra
flexibility and allows him to be more effective when
Excalibur isn’t present. However an item like a
portable hole requires more creativity to create a
cascade around.


#### Normal Gear

* 2pts, +1d
* Examples: Priest Gear, Mage Gear, General Tool
Kit, Sword, Guns

This may be professional gear, but it is common
enough that anyone in that profession will have access
to that gear.

#### Rare Gear

* Straight: 2pts per level, max +2d
* Cascade : 2pts, +2d, requires a related Normal
Gear
* Examples: Summoning Circle, Holy Symbol, Lock
Picks, Electronics Repair Kit, Sniper Rifle

This gear is more specialized, often requiring contacts
or special skills to make or use effectively

#### Unique Gear

* Straight: 2pts per level, max +3d
* Cascade : 2pts, +3d, requires a related Rare Gear
* Specific Magic Item w/ name/history, Rare
Equipment, Alien Tech
* Examples: Excalibur, Dad’s Lucky 9mm, Zendari
Lightening Gun, Unicorn Horn
* Generally loosing this item requires recovering the
exact same item from whoever currently has it

This is either a one of a kind item or an item whose
replacement would require the skills of a true master
and prolonged effort as well as rare resources.
