# Gear

This is an item that is part of the Hero’s story. This
doesn’t have to be hand held personal equipment,
but it usually is, the main exception are things
like vehicles. Stationary gear,
should probably be purchased as {{Locations}}.

Getting any gear requires an in-game opportunity to
acquire it. Gear is purchased with xp and so is part of
the Hero. The Hero can not be denied access to their
gear for prolonged period of time (much longer than a
scene or two) except for plot related reasons. 
Even then,  they
should be rewarded with Favor. 

These items can’t be
destroyed without replacement or compensation.

## Gear Groups

Gear can be purchased as a discreet item or as a
gear group. Generally speaking it is more advantageous to
buy a gear group but not all unique gear lends itself to a
gear group. A gear group is a set of boons representing a
description of the same item at various tiers of
effectiveness.

For example the unique sword, Excalibur, can be
purchased as Unique: Excalibur (tier 3), Rare: Magic
Sword (tier 2) or Normal: Sword (tier 1). A character
could buy a gear group which would include all three
boons for 6 points. This gives the character extra
flexibility and allows them to be more effective when
Excalibur isn’t present. However, an item like a
portable hole requires more creativity to create a
gear group around.

A xp starved Hero that acquires *Excalibur* during 
the course of the game could first buy the tier 1 *Sword* for 
2xp as the base of the gear group and work their way through
*Magic Sword* at tier 2,  before being able to buy 
*Excalibur* at tier 3.

## Normal Gear

Tier: 1  
Group Cost: 2xp  
Group Requirements: None  
Cost: 2xp

This is common gear that the Hero can basically 
get anywhere.  It's so common it probably doesn't 
even represent a specific item, but a set of gear
that the Hero uses as part of their normal professional 
identity.

```{admonition} Sample Common Gear
```{hlist}
:columns: 2
 
* Swords
* Priestly Vestments
* Spell Components and Foci 
* Engineers Toolkit
* Lockpicking Tools
* Cache of Guns
```

## Rare Gear

Tier: 1  
Group Cost: 2xp  
Group Requirements: A Common Gear version of this item.  
Cost: 4xp

Rare gear is more specialized and harder to find. 
A lot of utility gear that is hard to find and doesn't lend
itself to being a gear group exists at this level.  

This gear is more specialized, often requiring contacts
or special skills to make or use effectively.

```{admonition} Sample Rare Gear
```{hlist}
:columns: 2
 
* Magic Sword
* Saintly Holy Symbol
* Enchanted Wizard's Staff
* 3D Parts Printer
* Masterwork Lockpicks
* Sniper Rifle
* Bag of Holding
```

## Unique Gear

Tier: 3  
Group Cost: 2xp  
Group Requirements: A Rare Gear version of this item.  
Cost: 6xp

These are specific particular items.  They 
have names and histories, possibly name and 
histories that people know.  

This is either a one of a kind item or an item whose
replacement would require the skills of a true master
and prolonged effort as well as rare resources.

Or recover it from whoever currently has it.

## Kit Gear


```{sidebar} Kit Gear vs Props

Kit Gear differs from {{Props}} in that that Props can 
be used in Attribute Rolls, and it's the GM's duty
to take Props away.

A player may choose to convert a Prop to Kit Gear
or the other way around, but such a decision is 
permanent.
```

Tier: N/A  
Group Cost: N/A  
Group Requirements: None  
Cost: 0xp

Kit Gear is not actually a Boon and thus not Gear in a 
game mechanics sense.  These are things the Hero 
normally or always has on them, that the player wants
to make a note of.  

* Kit Gear offers no level of advantage for an 
Attribute Roll.
* Kit Gear doesn't have the same protection as 
actual Gear, but the GM shouldn't make any special 
effort to take it away or destroy it.

Being Kit Gear doesn't imply that the Gear is mundane or
easily acquired, only that the Hero doesn't use it to
overcome challenges effectively.  

Kit Gear may also be actual Gear that the Hero doesn't
yet have the XP to capitalize on.  If a Hero acquires
 *Excalibur*, but doesn't have the 6xp to buy it as 
[](#rare-gear), or even the 2xp for [](#normal-gear) yet
They might buy it as Kit Gear with the intent to upgrade it
as xp becomes available. 

A player can't start with any more than two pieces of Kit Gear.
