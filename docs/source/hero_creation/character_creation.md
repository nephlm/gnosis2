# Making a Hero

In addition to the demiurge which exist outside of
creation, each player also has a Hero. The Hero is
connected to the demiurge, though since creation isn’t
even aware of the existence of the demiurges, the Hero
certainly isn’t either.

It is the player’s responsibility to advocate for the
success of the hero. Although we call the Hero a hero,
depending on the campaign he may be more or less
heroic to downright unpleasant.

## Questions

Each player must answer the following 6 questions
for his hero. These questions will be used to give
a sense of who the hero is and determine his starting
bonuses. The starting bonuses have mechanical effects,
the answers to these questions otherwise only have
narrative effects, but that can be significant in itself.

### What’s on the Surface?

What does the Hero look like, what does he appear be.
What assumptions do people make by looking at him?
Who would be cast to play him in a movie?

### What is the Hero’s Vice?

What is the Hero’s weakness that drives him to make
poor decisions? Everyone has a blind spot that they
may or may not be aware of. What is your Hero’s
blind spot. A good vice drives the Hero forward into a
brick wall with great verve and enthusiasm. Try to
avoid your tactical mind to create meaningless vices,
it’ll make your Hero less fun and thus give you less
spotlight time.

### How is Your Hero a Badass?

What is it about the Hero the defies explanation. Does
he just keep coming no matter what kind of beating
he took or does he have a simply uncanny situational
awareness? What is it about the Hero that defines, not
in what situation he is a badass, but how, in that
situation, he is a badass.

Many people are good in a fight or debate, what we
want to know is how your Hero is good. What do the
Hero’s opponents ascribe their frustration to?

### What Does Your Hero Need to Accomplish?

What is your Hero’s goal? What is he driven to do?
Again interesting goals make fun Heroes. This can be
a long term goal or short term goal. If it is short term,
make sure it leads to the next goal or your Hero may
lose the spotlight.

### What Holds Your Hero Here?

What is it about this place that makes it home. Why
can’t your Hero leave, no matter what trouble comes?
What ties of honor, family, duty or hatred ensure that
your Hero still has something to do here. For
campaigns of global (universal/interdimensional)
scope this question may not apply, for others, `here`
might be large indeed.

### What Just Happened?

Something just happened to knock over your Hero’s
comfortable ant hill, what was it? This should be
something that the Hero doesn’t have the luxury of
ignoring. It doesn’t have to be explained or something
that is tied deeply into the Hero it just has to be
something to start the game off with a kick.

## Bonuses

Each Hero receives a free Key, Secret and Quest Card
(See Below). Those should be based on the answers to
the above questions.
Favor

Each hero is connected to the demiurge in ways that
are beyond explaining. Although the Hero is unaware
of the demiurge, the Demiurge is aware of the Hero
and grants the Hero Favor and gains status as the
Hero advances to completion of his story.

Each Hero begins with 2 points of Favor. The Hero
gains more Favor by exploring the creation of the
demiurges, fulfilling a Demiurge’s boasts and by being
true to the Hero’s nature (hitting his Keys).

Favor can be used to put a Hero into a scene, use a
Boon the Hero doesn’t have, activate Props and power
Secrets. Keys, Boons, Props and Secrets will be
explained below.
