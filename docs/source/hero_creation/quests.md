# Quests

How does a Hero advance without accomplishing great 
deeds?  How does a Hero fulfill their destiny and 
have a great character arc?  The answer is Quests.

The player, through their role as Demiurge, give the 
Hero a Quest, by giving it a cool name, and a specific
thing that must be accomplished.  

Besides the role of quests in Hero advancement they 
serve the much larger purposed in telegraphing to 
the table and the GM, what the Hero will be trying
to accomplish over the next session or two.  

It's not uncommon for Heroes to pick up very large
over arching Quests to communicate their 
campaign goals, 
as well as smaller goals showing what they wish to 
accomplish in the next session or two and 
to advance as a Hero. Some larger over-aching quests might 
better be modeled as [Paths](paths.md).

```{admonition} Example Quests

Hunting Scrap
: Acquire a pure orichalcum core to trade with the Atlantean
refugees. 

Freedom!
: Lead the oppressed people of Navarro to rise up and throw off
the yoke of the necromancer.

Rats in the Cellar
: Investigate the source of the soul eaters discovered in the 
hotel's wine cellar.

Special Skills
: Hunt down the kidnappers and free the Hero's abducted child.

Pigs and Moles
: Develop an informant among the corrupt city guard.

```

## Rewards

If the Hero is successful, they are rewarded.  This
reward may many things, but importantly **Quests are the 
only way for a Hero to gain {{xp}}**, which they can 
spend on [Boons](boons/boons.md) and [Edges](edges).



```{sidebar} Possible Rewards:

* Prop / contact / Kit Gear
* a point of Favor
* a point of Logos 
* 1-2 xp for a specific Boon
* 1-2 xp
* Combination of the above
```

Quests can be large or small, but should probably 
be at least a session's worth of effort. 
Less than that and 
the rewards may be non-existent or at least less 
than the Demiurge paid for the quest. 

**Quests cost a Logos for each quest, and each 
Hero starts with one Quest for free.** Initial 
Quests often relate to a Hero's {{Trouble}} or 
what [just happened](checklist.md#what-just-happened) before 
the beginning of play.

* Any Quest that is worthy of the Hero will 
Reward a Logos in combination with any other 
Rewards.  Not receiving Logos is a message that the 
Quest wasn't worthy.

    Quests that don't inform the GM what the Hero 
    intends before they actually do it, are usually
    considered unworthy.

* A Prop, Contact and Kit Gear are usually incidental
rewards or opportunities the Hero can choose to 
spend xp on later.  

    A Hero who wants a 
    *Magic Sword* may make a Quest and go after such a 
    sword, and if successful be granted a Prop or Kit Gear 
    version of a magic sword in addition to any xp, giving 
    them the opportunity to start investing into the 
    *Magic Sword* Boon. 
    
* Experience points can only be earned by completing Quests.

The GM is responsible for choosing the Reward.  They may set 
it when the Quest is acquired or more commonly when it is 
completed once it is revealed how worthy the Quest became.

Players must create Quests to gain xp, the GM should not create
Quests under normal circumstances. 


Quest Cards can be either individual, party or group It
will depend on the specific quest and how it is
accomplished.  It's often not possible to know whether 
an individual, party or group reward is appropriate 
for a Quest until it's revealed how the Quest is 
accomplished.

*   - Type
    - Notes
    - Example
    - Reward Notes
*   - Individual
    - Quests accomplished by just the Individual. 
    - A quest to sell one of the Hero's paintings to an influential patron.
    - Reward goes to the individual character.  Reward more likely to contain Props or xp toward specific gear. 
*   - Party
    - Quests accomplished by the whole party.  
    Likely the main quest for a session. 
    - Infiltrate the Kilarro Corporate Lab and steal the data.
    - All party members get a reward, though some may only be received 
    by a specific individual.  Only one player can actually get Excalibur.
*   - Group
    - Quests that took many sessions to accomplish.  
    - Stop the Necromancer and his army of Undead from conquering the land.
    - All group members get a reward, even if they weren't present when the quest was actually completed.

## Abandoning a Quest

Sometimes quests are overcome by events.  When the quest was created it
was indeed the Hero's intent to follow it and complete the Quest, however
since then new information has come to light and the Quest no longer 
matches the Hero's goals.  

> A player created a quest to destroy the Vampire's of Santa Fe, however
it comes to light, that the Vampires would love to stop collecting all that 
blood, they don't really need it for themselves, they need it to keep the 
sleeping demon in their care, you know, asleep.

Maybe the player creates a new Quest to find a way to banish the demon,
maybe the player abandons the thread, in either case the Quest won't be 
completed, and the player won't get the [Logos](../tools/currency.md#logos)
they invested in the current quest back. 

If a quest was created three or more sessions ago, and no actions 
have been taken to pursue it in the current or previous session, 
the player may abandon the quest.

The Quest it erased as if it never existed, and the player gets their 
Logos back.  This can be done at anytime during a session that meets 
the criteria.  The Logos can be banked or spent immediately.
