# Quests

The demiurge gains status with the Story and the
Hero gains power within creation by
accomplishing tasks that are worth telling stories
about. The Story rewards the creation of story.

The demiurge may spend a point of Logos and boast to
the Story the things his hero will do. In game this
boast is represented by the quest card. A quest card
consists of three things:

* A title
* A specific thing that must be accomplished to
complete the quest
* A reward for completing the quest

The GM may create a quest card without expenditure
of Logos, but they are under no obligation to do so and is
discouraged from the practice. If the players don’t
wish to spend their demiurge’s Logos, it is an
indication that they aren’t interested in that story line
and should not be forced into it. A demiurge can
create a Quest Card at any time, however the Story is
dismissive of boasts of obvious events and offers no or
minimal rewards for such boasts.

The player whose demiurge spends the Logos specifies
the title and quest, the GM specifies the reward. If the
GM does not believe the quest is either interesting or
creates a challenge or conflict he does not have to
create a reward. This is to discourage quests of
"crossing the street."

Quest Cards can be either individual, party or group It
will depend on the specific quest and how it is
accomplished. A hero with a quest to sell one of his
paintings would most likely gain an individual award,
unless he called in help in the task. Quests with
awards of a prop or specific gear are also often
individual, or at least that part of the reward is.
Quests that the group collaborates on will usually be
party rewards, major story arcs are usually group
awards (everyone who has a character, even if they
aren’t there). It is possible for quest to have a different
reward for an individual and the party who helps him.

Possible Rewards:

* a point of Favor
* a point of Logos (Most rewards above this level
    should also include a point of Logos.)
* Prop
* A contact
* 1 xp specific Boon
* 1 xp
* 2 xp specific Boon
* 2 xp
* 3 xp specific Boon
* 3 xp
* Combination of the above

This is the only way to get xp.  Players create one free
quest card during character creation.
