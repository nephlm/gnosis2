# World Creation

Since all the players make the world together, 
each campaign must start with a pitch session
where players come together and decide what game 
they want to play.

## Tone

Before getting specific ideas or pitches on the table it
might be beneficial to spend a moment to decide on
tone. Are people looking for a something epic, 
light four color heroes or even a cartoon sort of
game? Nothing is written in stone but get the feeling
of the people at the table.

The system itself skews fairly heroic, lacking mechanisms 
to permanent disfigurement, sanity loss and other systems
common in darker games.  This can be adjusted, but more work
will be required to play a deadly dark game.

## Pitches

Any pitch session should start by asking what people
don’t want to play. Are people burned out on 
western fantasy or cyberpunk? 
It’s best to know that early.

Next it's time for some pitches.  Don’t bother
to get specific, just write them down and move on. 
If it takes more
than a sentence or two, there is too much detail. 
This is a proper elevator pitch, with only a few seconds
to relay the core of the idea.

After there are four or five pitches on the table, 
start alternately delving into the pitches to see what they 
mean to the table and eliminating ideas that
aren’t grabbing the table's attention. Keep
asking questions and letting players answer.
Write down the answers to these questions, but for
reasons that we'll explore later none of the
answers are *true* yet.

Feel free to mix and match elements from various
pitches. How else do you get space westerns? After
unpacking a few ideas if one emerges that the table
likes go with that. If no consensus emerges that clicks
with everyone don’t be afraid to throw it all away
and start again, getting new pitches.

Once a pitch the whole table likes emerges, make sure 
everyone agrees where the major knobs are set.  
Depending on how developed the pitch was it may be self
evident.

### Tech Level

    Stone
    Medieval
    Steam
    Digital
    Cybernetic
    Nanotech
    Space
    Interstellar
```

What is the level of technology in the
world? Is everyone at the same tech level,  or do
different cultures or countries use vastly different
technologies? Does the pitch resonate or even dictate a particular 
tech level?  No hard and fast rules are needed at this point,
just get enough to avoid confusion. 

The world may also have very different tech levels for different 
technologies.  For example high biological tech, but limited
information tech.  For extremely advanced
technologies it may be thought of more as magic than
tech. 

## Magic Level

Another meta question is what is the place and
prevalence of magic? Is the group looking for a game
where fireballs and rings of invisibility are common
occurrences,  or is magic rare, dangerous and hard? 

Make sure everyone is on at least a similar page. 
If there is magic, what sorts of magic exist in the world?  
Players will get a chance to decide when they move through 
world creation, but first let's learn about
