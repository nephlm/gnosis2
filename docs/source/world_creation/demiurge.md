# The Demiurge and Logos

## The Demiurge

The demiurge is ineffable and there isn’t much we can
define about it. All we can say for sure is that the
demiurge exists outside of time and creation and is
incapable of directly affecting creation by any physical
act. What the demiurge can do is create things within
creation.

When the demiurge speaks, creation rearranges itself to
make the demiurge’s words true. Each such creation
altering pronouncement drains the demiurge, taking its
vital force.

This vital force is measured in Logos, which is a
measure of the demiurge’s ability to alter creation.

## Starting Logos

During setting creation each player including the
GM gets 2 Logos to spend on Setting Facts and
1 Logos to spend on Metaphysics. If these aren’t spent
during setting creation, they are lost.

Each demiurge can have a maximum number of Logos
equal to 3 plus half their Hero’s possibility die (5, 6 or
7), and start the campaign with their maximum. The
player may spend these during character creation.

The GM begins each session with 2 Logos per player.

## Recovering Logos

Once per session, after a demiurge has spent Logos
or set a price a player may award that demiurge
a point of Logos. If there is a demiurge with no Logos
he can be awarded Logos at any time. Each player can
only award one point of Logos per session.

Demiurges may never have more Logos than their
maximum (even for the brief fraction of a second to
spend them).

A Demiurge also regains Logos by his Hero
completing quests and when the Demiurge’s creation
come up in the story. Both of these methods are
described above.
