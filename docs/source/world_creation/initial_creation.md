Now it's time to look back at the pitch and make it into a setting.

## High Concept

Cement the High Concept of the setting.  This may be the pitch itself
if it's sufficiently pithy, or it may be series title or any other 
way to nail down this specific campaign.  

Some groups may choose to create there facts first and let those 
guide the campaign's High Concept, others will choose to do it 
the other way around.  

If possible the High Concept should incorporate the Campaign's 
key Trouble.  

## Setting Facts

Each player has three pre-game {{Logos}} that must
be spent to establish [Facts](facts.md).

None of the things the players decided about the setting
are True yet.  First a player must spend their {{Logos}} and 
accept the {{Price}}. Players may choose to make those {{Facts}}
real or create entirely different facts.

Ideas that were generated during the pitch session may need
to be split up into multiple facts if they are too broad. 
Edit and revise them until they conform to the breadth 
of facts discussed in the rules about facts.

Each player who will be making a
Hero has 3 Logos that must be spent. Two of which
must be spent to establish Setting 
[Facts](facts.md) and one which
may be spent on 
{abbr}`Metaphysics (Facts that govern the breadth and function of magic or technology.)` or 
{abbr}`Setting Facts (Facts that govern the existence and power of organizations and social structures.)`.

If the GM chooses, they may claim their 3 tokens as well, but
since they will be setting the price on all the player facts,
if often is unnecessary. 

Any pre-game {{Logos}} that is not spent is lost once this phase 
world creation is done. 

Any pitch facts that aren't paid for with Logos and a 
{{Price}}, aren’t established in the game, yet. 
After Heroes are created player’s may spend Logos to establish 
additional {{Facts}}.

Once that's done, it's time to create some [Heroes](../hero_creation/character_creation.md).
