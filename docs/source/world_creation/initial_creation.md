Each player who will be making a
character has 3 Logos that must be spent. Two of them
must be spent to establish Setting 
[Facts](facts.md) and one which
must be spent on Metaphysics.

If the GM chooses, they may claim their 3 tokens as well, but
since they will be setting the price on all the player facts,
if often is unnecessary. 

Go back to the list of
facts that were generated when you were
unpacking the chosen [pitch](world_creation.md). 
They are all up for bid.

Edit and revise them until the corm to the breadth 
of facts discussed in the rules about facts.  Initial
ideas associated with pitches may need to be broken up 
into several smaller facts.

Any facts that either no one wants to buy, or for
which no one has Tokens left to buy aren’t established
in the game, yet. After Heroes are created and play
starts player’s may spend Logos to establish new facts 
and players can fill in anything they didn't have 
[Logos](demiurge.md) for during initial world creation, 
if they choose.

With some broad facts about the world established,
probably with specific Heroes in mind, it is time to get
to creating those Heroes.
