# Tools

Tools are the various systems that aren't as fundamental 
as conflict and resolution, but the game will play
very different without them.  These systems tend to add 
more mechanical touchpoints, and without them the game 
will probably feel more narrative.  

The rest of the text assumes they are in play, some of them
such as currency are heavily used, but if your group doesn't 
feel the need to limit how often facts and quests are created 
or Edges used, then it's a system that can be dropped.
