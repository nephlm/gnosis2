# Flashbacks

If your table is the sort that will get bogged down in 
planning something to death --perhaps you have an engineer
or two playing-- then the flashback mechanic is your 
get out of planning hell free card.  

Flashbacks are simply a special form of [Maneuver](modifiers.md#maneuver) that 
allows the Hero to take advantage of the planning they did 
quietly off-screen, only when it becomes relevant, rather 
than spending time doing planning that may not apply. 

Flashbacks tend to be more narrative while Maneuvers are more
mechanical.  Maneuvers tend to be taking an action, 
that gives a mechanical advantage, 
while Flashbacks tend to be more likely to change the 
narrative situation.  This may lead to lead to 
exploitable [circumstances](modifiers.md#circumstances)
that can be exploited, but the link is less direct.

## Approach

If the group chooses to forego the planning session, they 
instead choose a general approach: hit them fast and hard, 
sneak in over the roofs, or con their way in.

Each Hero makes an Attribute Roll, putting together an 
appropriate strategy for their Hero.  Any planning or 
intel related [Boons](../hero_creation/boons/boons.md) 
can be freely shared.

The Pain Pool should be appropriate for how well defended 
target is, but it should be on the low side, the expectation
is that the Hero will get at least a success against a
target of equal threat. 

Successes give one free flashback, critical successes grant
two.  Even with no successes the Hero can still pay a 
{{Favor}} and do a flashback, as can a Hero that has 
already used their free flashbacks.

## Use

Flashbacks aren't usually used in the middle of a challenge, 
but something that is done before the dice come out. 
After using one of their free flashbacks or spending a 
Favor the player narrates what their Hero did to prepare
for this situation.

A flashback is not time travel, if something has been described 
in the present, it can't be undone by a flashback.  If a guard
has been described as watching the door, a flashback won't let 
your Hero have killed him the night before, but they could have
gotten them drunk into the wee hours of the morning, so the guard
is hung over, though it might have been wiser to hire someone 
to do that. 

A flashback may, and probably does, entail a simple challenge.
Anything less than that, probably doesn't require a flashback, 
and anything more, probably can't be done in a flashback.  

Major plot points are beyond the scope of a flashback.  The 
Hero can't kill the major villain or steal the McGuffin, but
they can make those things easier in the present. 

The guiding principle remains to make stories together, so 
a flashback that doesn't make the story better, probably shouldn't
be allowed.
