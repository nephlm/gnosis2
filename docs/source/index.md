## The Story, the Demiurge and the Hero

In the beginning there was just the Story. The Story
was perfect and ineffable, but it was also
incomplete. To be complete, the Story had to express
itself in material and spirit. But the physical world
and even the spirit are imperfect, and the Story could 
not manifest itself in such a world.

The Story created the
Demiurges, perfect and ineffable, but not as perfect or as ineffable. 
The demiurges, small little fragments of the Story, unbalance in impure, 
could create what the Story could not, imperfection.

The demiurges, as shadows of the Story, manifested their 
shadow of the Stories will in imperfect creation.
They followed the Stories lead and created their
own fragments within creation, the hero. 

Each player will play both an agent of creation, a
demiurge, and a hero, unknowingly playing a part in the 
Story's plan.

You've found yourself at the website of a narrative table top role playing game
where all the players contribute to world building and story creation. 
Hopefully that is where you want to be, whether you came here on purpose or 
the providence of a demiurge sent you without you realizing it.
