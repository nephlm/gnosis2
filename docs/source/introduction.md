# Introduction

Gnosis is a collaborative roleplaying game in which
the responsibility for world creation is the
ongoing responsibility of all the players at the table. In
more traditional roleplaying game there is one player,
the GM, who is a responsible for creating the world.

One of the goals of Gnosis is to turn that on its head.
There is nothing wrong with the traditional mode of
play, but it does have some drawbacks if you are the
GM. Specifically detailed world creation takes time, as
gamers grow older with other responsibilities the time
may not exist to dedicate to game preparation.
Another issue is with player engagement. Occasionally
the other players aren’t engaged by the story being
told.

Gnosis attempts to tackle those issues by several
mechanisms. First, since world creation, including the
metaphysics of the world, is done at the table by all
participants, all players should be able to drive the
story in a direction that they find engaging. And since
all participants are doing this, the responsibility of
game prep doesn’t fall on the shoulders of one person.

There still is a GM, and he is responsible for many
aspects of making a game fun. But what he isn’t
responsible for is world creation or making stat blocks
for enemies

Each player will receive a number of `Logos` which
they can spend to establish facts in the world. If a
player wants his character to be part of a multi-nation
smuggling ring, he can establish the existence of such a
ring by spending Logos. To keep things interesting,
every fact that is established in the world comes with
an additional fact that works against those that
benefited from the original fact. This is the price of
power of creation by imperfect beings. Even the GM
must spend Logos to create facts, and even his facts
have prices.

Players can also use Logos to relay to the GM and
other players which direction they’d like the story to
go. They do these by spending Logos to create quests.
When someone accomplishes a quest they (or another
player) created, they get x If a player wants to drive
the game in a diplomatic direction all he needs to do is
spend his Logos to create quests that can be
accomplished through diplomacy.

To keep the GM from spending hours creating a
detailed statblock only to have the other players
destroy the villain it represents in minutes, Gnosis
represents villains (and any other challenge) only
abstractly. Someone might have to spend time figuring
out how to narrate what the villain does, but no time
has to go into how to represent him in game.

With those goals in mind let us move forward into
world creation.
