# The Demiurge and Logos



## The Demiurge

```{card} Demiurge 
/ˈdemēˌərj/

(noun) A less perfect being responsible for the creation of the
material universe, subordinate to the perfect, 
purely spiritual creator.
```

The demiurge is ineffable as any other being that exists
outside of time and creation, so there is little we can say about it, 
but each player gets to play one.  Each player also plays a 
[hero](../hero_creation/character_creation.md), but before 
there is a hero, there must be creation.

When the demiurge speaks, creation rearranges itself to
make the demiurge’s words true. Each such act of creation
drains the demiurge, taking a bit of its
voice

This voice is measured in Logos, a
measure of the demiurge’s ability to alter creation.

## Starting Logos

During setting creation each player including the
GM gets 2 Logos to spend on Setting Facts and
1 Logos to spend on Metaphysics. If these aren’t spent
during setting creation, they are lost.

Once initial world creation is complete, each player's
demiurge starts the campaign with six Logos.  
Demiurges may have a maximum of six Logos, if they gain 
more than six during play it is immediately lost and 
can't be spent.

Players
may spend these initial Logos during character creation 
if they choose.

The GM begins each session with 2 Logos per player.

## Recovering Logos

A player's Demiurge may gain Logos in a number of ways.

* Once per session, each player may award another player 
a point of Logos. 
* At the beginning of each session each player gains a Logos.
* When a Hero completes a quest, a player is usually awarded a 
Logos.
* The third time a particular fact created by a player's demiurge
comes up in play the player gains a Logos.

Demiurges may never have more Logos than their
maximum (even for the brief fraction of a second to
spend them).
