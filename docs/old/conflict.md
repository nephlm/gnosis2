# Conflict

Simple Conflict

A simple conflict is minor challenge, the sort of
thing that will be handled by a single player
saying, “I got this”, and rolling some dice and the
challenge will be either overcome or changed in some
way.

Simple Conflicts can either be overcome, neutralized or
changed.

A Hero that overcomes a conflict does not change it.
This is usually overcoming a conflict through stealth,
subterfuge and to lesser extent deception. This is often
sidestepping the conflict. It also comes into play with
challenges that are beyond the Hero’s ability to
change, such as climbing a mountain.

A Hero may also neutralize a conflict. This happens
when the conflict has been completely handled and so
the characters that come after him are not challenged
by it. Knocking out a guard or breaking down a door
would fairly effectively neutralize the conflict for the
Heroes that followed.

Sometime the conflict is simply changed by the
character’s actions. This is likely to occur when there is
a tie, but happens in other situations as well. For
example, a character who lies his way past a guard will
create new openings and close off others for those who
follow him.

> Emit, Henry and Issabelle need to get by a guard.
Issabelle chooses to employ stealth and is successful.
This doesn’t directly help Emit and Henry. Emit
decides he’s going to knock the guard over the head
with a baseball bat. If he’s successful, Henry doesn’t
need to do anything, because the threat has not only
been overcome, but actually neutralized.

There is only a single resolution phase in simple
conflicts.

Success grants the Hero’s Intent and generally
removes/sidesteps/overcomes the obstacle. Failure will
end to change the problem. The character will receive
failure ranks (or damage if whatever the pain pool
represents was physically dangerous). After rolling a
simple conflict, something has substantively changed. It
is not possible to just try again after failing.

Simple conflicts are things like getting past a lone
unnamed guard, getting the books from inside a locked
safe, getting across the river, etc. Generally simple,
isolated conflicts of minor importance in the scheme of
things.

They should only be rolled if something interesting
could happen both in success and failure. If there is
only one interesting outcome, that is what happens.

## Complex Conflicts

Complex Conflicts occur when the conflict is
more dangerous or requires the combined effort
of a group to overcome or neutralize it. These are
threats that are greater or equal in power to the
characters individually.

Each character gets an resolution phase, and the
antagonist also gets his own. Heroes can take failure
levels or damage for failing their attempt.

During adversary initiated action the GM has final
narrative authority. Players are encouraged to make
recommendations.

### Multiple Adversaries

Sometimes the conflict isn’t one single powerful entity,
a large number of weaker opponents. Each individual
guard is a laughable threat, but when you get 20 of
them together the threat is much more serious.

If it’s Credible that the adversary/adversaries could
attack multiple Heroes, the pain pool is reduced by one
die for each additional target for this action. The GM
rolls once and all affected Heroes must roll a defense
and the Effect is figured out individually for each
targeted Hero. The Pain Pool can inflict damage to or
suffer backlash from all targeted Heroes.

### Multiple Conflicts

Every once in a while the Hero’s two biggest enemies
decide to attack him simultaneously. The GM decides
it doesn’t make sense to group them together as a
single pain pool. Which enemy the character’s
attack/defeat/allow to escape/etc matters.

In such a case each adversary is its own pain pool and
get there own resolution phase. Health tokens are
tracked separately.

## Borrowed Boons

Somtimes characters gain access to boons which are
not their own. Examples of this is when characters
work together or when attempting to recall the
reputation of another player character.

In the first case only one character makes the roll
though he may borrow the boons of anyone who helps
him. He still can only add a single boon to each
attribute pool, but he may be able to trade up to more
effective boons by relying on the specialties of those
who decide to help him.

> Good Cop wishes to interrogate a suspect. He has cop
(+1d) and persuade (+2d). He also has a friend, Bad
Cop, who has intimidate(+2d). Good Cop can use all
those boons to try and get the suspect to confess.

Their boss, Chief, could also help but since every
attribute pool already has a boon, he would have to
replace one of the other boons. In the end they add
Intimidate (+2d) from Bad Cop to power, Persuade
(+2d) from Good Cop for Precision and the Chief’s
Criminal Mind (+2d) for Possibility.

Another example of borrowing boons is when two
player characters meat for the first time and they are
curious what they know each other. If one character
has Crime Boss (+1d) (or something similar), any
character could use that boon and add it to their role
to determine his reputation.

The above two are simply examples of cases when
boons can be borrowed, use them as guidelines for
other situations.

## It's All Props

A
large number of things that you may not think
of as props, actually are props. A character is at
the front of an army storming a castle, in that
situation, that army is a prop. To the character
defending the castle, the castle itself very well may be
a prop. The vats of boiling oil certainly are. You mind
control someone, they become a prop.

Somtimes it’s not even something so tangible. A sniper
takes a firing position on top of a building, that
superior position is a prop.

## Recovery

At the end of a scene all of a Hero’s failure ranks
are recovered and any boons that were
downshifted to activate Edges recover that downshift
damage.

Players will roll 1d6 and recover that number of levels
of damaged boons. Like taking damage, each boon in a
Cascade is counted as a single level. Cascades must
recover lower ranked boons before higher ranks can be
recovered. Hero’s can’t recover more damage than
they took in this way. Recovery can only be used to
recover damage taken in the preceding scene.

If a character surrenders instead of being taken out he
gains a +1d to his post scene recovery roll.

To recover damage that did not recover at the end of a
scene the character must do something relaxing and
therapeutic. During which he recovers 1d6 additional
damage without the requirement that the damage
occur in the preceding scene.

Damage will also naturally recover at a rate of 1 point
per scene.

Not that this is default rate of realing and defines a
fairly heroic mode of play. Healing is one of the major
tenets that controls pacing of a game, if you wish
slower games with more time between scenes, reduce
the rate of healing.
