# Downtime Activities

Eventually your group will encounter downtime, whether
it's driven by a need to rest and recover or because 
they need to wait until the Queen's Masquerade to 
implement the next part of their plan, there will
come a time when the pace slows down, and the Heroes
get a chance to breath.

This is downtime and there are two main theories on what
a downtime scene should be: 

* Time a Hero goes off on their own and does some cool 
stuff driven by their personal goals, or
* Activities done quietly off-screen, between adventures.

Both definitions are correct, and sometimes the later can 
become the former.  Which your group normally does is up
to the table.

If your table normally does the former, most downtime 
actions will be some sort of 
[Sidequest](#sidequests--solo-adventures).

## Downtime Actions

Heroes get downtime actions per downtime, not per day of 
downtime. That first day of downtime they are full of 
energy and possibilities, but you know how it goes, 
before they know they're spending most of their time 
playing board games at the local brewery.



| Downtime Length   | Number of Actions | 
| :-                |:-: |
| At least 1 day    | 1 action |
| At least 1 week   | 2 actions |
| At least 1 month  | 3 actions |
| At least 6 months | 4 actions |
| At least 1 year   | 5 actions |


## Recovery

It is possible a Hero has been forced into downtime
by {{Stress}} or {{Blood}} and they may be spending 
their downtime engaging in activities that help them 
recover from whatever wounds, physical or psychic, 
they are suffering.

The exact activities that help a Hero recover vary 
between Heroes.  One Hero may recover from humiliation
at the Queen's Masquerade by carousing at the 
Lowtown Tavern, while others may recover by spending 
time in private meditation.

Similarly, the mixed martial artist may work through
their physical recovery at the gym, the professor
may do it my diving into their books and staying off
their bad leg.

The activity should be personal to the Hero.  

Whatever the activity, the mechanics are the same.
Spend a Downtime Action recovering and get a 
Recovery Roll, which is just an Attribute Roll. 
Build an appropriate {{Strategy}} for recovery
and roll the dice. 

Recovery Rolls are not normally affected by 
Stress and Blood.

## Group Projects

## Private Projects


## Sidequests / Solo-adventures

This is likely the most rewarding form of Downtime 
activities, but by its nature it excludes most of the 
group, relegating them to observers, so this shouldn't
be something that plays out at the table.  

Sometimes the constraints of real life
dictate what can be done, but in the era of asynchronous 
communications, being able to play out a bite sized 
encounter or event is not out of the question.

The key is to say, "Okay, we'll handle that offline."
There will be some degree of playing fast and loose with 
time, but it's hardly the oddest abstraction that happens
in a game.

This sort of Downtime activity should be deeply connected 
to the Hero's ambition and character arc.

These should really be bite-sized and shouldn't involve more 
one or two challenges.  

The results are completely open.  Any of the other results can 
granted by a solo-adventure it a much cooler way.
