# Boons

Boon is the general name for a host of abilities that
make the Hero more effective.

Hero’s pay xp for these and can’t loose them without
being compensated by either the return of xp or an
equivalent capability, whichever the player chooses. It
is possible for Hero’s to temporarily loose access to
Boons.

During resolution, the player will roll their Hero’s
Attribute Pools (i.e. a d8, a d6 and d4). If the
character has boons that apply to the situation he will
add additional dice to one of the attribute pools,
though he will only keep one die from each pool.
During any given roll the player may only add one
boon to each Attribute Pool.

It may be simpler to explain by example:

> When Talia was a young girl, she had no special skills
but got in a fight anyway. She would roll her attribute
pools, in this case d8 d6 d4 and add those number up.
After having gotten in a number of fights, Talia
purchases the Tough (+1d) broad talent. Next time
she gets in a fight she’ll apply tough to her power pool.
Talia happens to have put a d8 in her power attribute,
so when she roles in her next fight she’ll roll 2d8 d6
d4, but she’ll discard one of the d8s and keep d8 d6 d4.

> Still later on she learns how to use a dagger very
precisely and so she picks up the Dagger (+1d)
common gear. When Talia next gets in a fight, she
adds Tough to her Power pool and Dagger to her
precision pool. She can not add both Tough and
Dagger to her Power pool as each attribute pool can
only use one Boon in any given roll. So Talia (with a
d6 Precision) will roll 2d8 2d6 d4, discard a d8 and a
d6 thus keeping a d8 d6 d4.

Boons range from +1d to +3d

Characters can only add one boon per attribute pool.
The die type of the boon is the same size as the
attribute pool. Boons are not attribute pool specific
but they often have affinities. The boon ‘Strong Arm’ 
will rarely find use in the Possibility pool. However,
that one time when you are trying to convince the arm
wrestling champion of something....

Boons come in 4 flavors: Talents, Gear, Network and
Location.
