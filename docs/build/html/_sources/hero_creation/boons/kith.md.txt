# Kith

> Kith:   
> : /kiTH/ (noun) One's friends, acquaintances, and relations.


A Heroâ€™s Kith describes the people 
and organizations the Hero
knows and can turn to for help. 


Organizations bought as part of the Hero's Kith
have an anchor who is Hero's primary contact inside the
organization.


Heroes can use members of their Kith
as Boons when they are
present, agree to help, and they have a relevant skill set.
A Hero looking for a way past a guard could add their tier 2 
familiar, a Companion, as their Possibility Boon for example.

Sometimes it is enough just to know someone or be part of 
an organization.  A Hero trying to talk his way into 
a posh party could drop a name or mention their membership
and use that Kith as part of their Attribute Roll {{Strategy}}.

Membership and friendship, and a flock of convenience is a 
two-way road.  Sometimes it's the Hero who is being called 
on to render aid or help with some problem. 

A Kith Boon is one of three levels:

* **Companion**: A person or group that travels with
the Hero.
* **Ally**: A person or group that the Hero has a 
history and generally shared goals or some kind
of understanding.
* **Contacts**: These are people the Hero has met, 
they may even have shared goals, but the Hero
hasn't invested in that relationship or 
perhaps the person is just unreliable. 

A player can spend xp and upgrade a Contact to an
Ally or an Ally to Companion during play.  
Downgrading is also possible.  Either direction
requires some sort of in-game justification.

**Heroes start the game with up to two 
Contacts.**

## Kith Tier

A member of the Hero's Kith has a maximum tier set
by the maximum impact they could have.  A *Galactic Overlord*
is going to be able to impact much more than a 
*Local Bartender* in the same game. In most games
the *Galactic Overlord* could reach tier 3, while 
in that sort of game the *Local Bartender* would 
probably be stuck at a maximum of tier 1.  

As with any Boon, the Hero could only spend the
xp to acquire the *Galactic Overlord* at tier 1.  
For whatever reason when the *Galactic Overlord* 
provides help to the Hero, it's considerably less
aid than they could provide. 

The maximum tier is set by what the Table thinks is 
appropriate for that NPC in that Game.  If 
necessary, the GM can make the final determination.

## Contact

Cost: 0xp

These are people or groups that the Hero only has a 
fleeting relationship with.  They may share a goal 
or outlook, but there is little shared history or 
earned trust.  

Most NPC that the Hero encounters could be developed 
into Contacts.  It takes more than just seeing them 
on a street, but if the Hero exchanges phone numbers
or whatever is the equivalent in the game, 
could be considered a Contact.

Unlike normal Kith Boons, Contacts can't 
usually be used as part of a Hero's {{Strategy}}.
The GM is free to make exceptions if it makes sense
in the fiction or if the Hero did something, such 
as a Maneuver to be able to use the Contact.

## Ally

Cost: 1xp per tier  

These are people who will normally answer the Hero's 
call in most circumstances and will usually take time 
to provide a reasonable amount of help.  Allies 
trust the Hero and will usually take on faith that 
they are trying to do something worth doing.

However, they do have their own lives and do something 
for a living, probably something the involves deadlines, 
so they aren't about to drop anything a follow the 
Hero across the country, or possibly even the city
without a good reason.

```

## Companion

* 2xp per level

Companions are almost always with the Hero.  When the Hero 
decides to board a spaceship for Alpha Centauri, their
Companions are there with them.

The Hero and their Companions have been through a lot together, 
there is a lot of earned trust and shared history.  They are 
deeply involved in each other's lives and usually don't need much 
justification to meet the Hero in a dark alley at 3am, or 
bend whatever rules are needed to cover for the Hero.

They are flawed and make mistakes, but to the degree possible, 
they'll have the Hero's back.
