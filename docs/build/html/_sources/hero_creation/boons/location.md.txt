Locations are places where the Hero has home field
advantage.  Maybe from years living on the streets 
of that place, or it could be their own apartment 
building or a place they spent a lot of time.

Locations come in two varieties contiguous 
real estate, such as a neighborhood or a city
and types of places like bars or research labs.

The larger the location or more general and common
the kind of places the less advantage the Hero
can squeeze from this Boon.  The places Heroes 
can get the most benefit are all singular unique 
buildings

Locations can be built in groups like 
[](gear.md).  The higher levels being more 
specific or subgroups of the broader parent
location.  The City 
*Washington, D.C.* might have a 
Neighborhood of *Capitial Hill* which might itself
have a Building of *U.S. Capital*.

## City / Common

Max Tier: 1  
Cost: 5xp/tier  
Group Requirement: None  
Group Cost: 5xp

This Boon represents a large part of the campaign world (but not all of it), 
or commonly available sorts of locations.  

In a dimension hopping fantasy this could be a whole dimension,
while in a city centered story it might be the financial district. 
How big the space should be is greatly impacted by how big the {{adventuring}}
space is.  

It could also be a commonly encountered *kind* of location, 
such as coffee houses, schools or transit stations.

## Neighborhood / Rare

Max Tier: 2  
Cost: 5xp/tier  
Group Requirement: Related City or Common Location  
Group Cost: 5xp

Like City sized Locations, 
the size of this Boon is dependent on the scope of the 
campaign, in a story where the Heroes travel between 
a dozen cities, this would be a city, for a city 
based story, the Hero could probably cross it in 
fifteen minutes on foot.  

Locations that are a *kind* of place become more rarified;
universities, government buildings or tourist destinations.  
The kind of places that there are only a few in 
each major part of the {{adventuring}} space.  

At this scale the Location might be a combination 
of both real estate and a common kind of location,
*Downtown Coffee Shops*, *Suburban Schools* 
or *Seattle Ley Lines*.

## Building

Max Tier: 3  
Cost: 5xp/tier  
Group Requirement: Related Neighborhood or Rare Location  
Group Cost: 5xp

At this level, this is almost certainly a specific 
building or set of buildings, even in the most 
expansive campaigns. 

In theory this could be a 
rare kind of location in a neighborhood sized 
space, but that generally 
means a single building in all but truly 
multiverse or interstellar scale campaigns.
