# Talents

Talents represent intrinsic parts of a character
such as skills, aptitudes, inherent powers, etc.
By their nature, these abilities can't normally 
be taken away, even temporarily without significantly
scrambling the Hero or Creation.

Each Talent is unique and free form, there is no
finite pre-written list, only samples of possible 
Talents.  Ideally they 
should be the same sort of pithy phrase as the 
Hero's High Concept.  

 As the tier increases, the Talents
becomes increasingly narrow. 
Higher tier Talents require related lower tier 
Talents, and are usually a 
specialization of that lower tier Talent.

*The Hero's High Concept is a free tier 1 Talent.*

## Broad Talent

Tier: 1  
Cost: 3xp  
Requirements: None


Tier 1 talents are shockingly broad covering 
entire contexts.  Professions, areas of study 
or entire hobbies are appropriate Broad Talents.
Talents that represent what the Hero *is* 
often fit into the Broad Talent category.
Access to Metaphysics are often unlocked 
via a Broad Talent.

Due to their breadth, sometimes the Broad Talents
that first come to mind are 
short, only a word or two, but consider adding 
more color to them.  A Broad Talent such as
*Fighting* could be chosen, but 
*Soldier in the Atlantean Armed Forces* could 
be used in all the ways *Fighting* could be used
as well some other ways related to Atlantis, 
Atlantis Armed Forces, being a soldier, etc.
It also opens up tier 2 Talents associated to 
those things that *Fighting* wouldn't be able to.

## Common Talent

Tier: 2  
Cost: 3xp  
Requirements: Related tier 1 Talent

Common Talents are narrower than Broad Talents, 
representing a more specialized skill.  
A Hero with a *Professor of Sciences* Broad Talent 
might narrow their field to a specific science, while
someone with some sort of Fighting related Talent might
focus on specific weapons or techniques at this tier. 

Common Talents are generally applicable to a major 
field of study, generally a player does not have 
to work too hard for them to apply to a {{Strategy}}.
Every Common Talent requires a parent Broad Talent 
that's at least related if not clearly a superset.

## Master Talent

Tier: 3  
Cost: 3xp  
Requirements: Related tier 2 Talent, GM discussion


Master Talents are like a PhD thesis, they are 
about knowing more and more about less and less. 

While Broad Talents almost always apply to a situation, 
and Common Talents take little work to make apply, 
Master Talents generally require the Hero take some 
effort to get them to apply to any given situation. 

In order to be a master talent,
the Heroâ€™s player will have to take actions to
make it applicable, rather than the GM having to
take action make it inapplicable.

These Talents are laser focused on one specific thing.
Combat maneuvers generally require specific 
conditions to apply, such as when fighting multiple 
foes, or only after having taken a {{Consequence}}.

In order for a Hero to choose a Master Talent the
player must consult with the GM
or the table at large, so everyone agrees on the 
focus and limitations on the Talent. 
Heroes can not start with Master Talents.
