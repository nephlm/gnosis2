# Finishing Touches

## Questions

### How is Your Hero a Badass?

What is it about the Hero defies explanation. Does
he just keep coming no matter what kind of beating
he took or does he have a simply uncanny situational
awareness? What is it about the Hero that defines, not
in what situation he is a badass, but how, in that
situation, he is a badass.

Many people are good in a fight or debate, what we
want to know is how your Hero is good. What do the
Hero’s opponents ascribe their frustration to?

### What Does Your Hero Need to Accomplish?

What is your Hero’s goal? What is he driven to do?
Again interesting goals make fun Heroes. This can be
a long term goal or short term goal. If it is short term,
make sure it leads to the next goal or your Hero may
lose the spotlight.



### What Just Happened?

Something just happened to knock over your Hero’s
comfortable ant hill, what was it? This should be
something that the Hero doesn’t have the luxury of
ignoring. It doesn’t have to be explained or something
that is tied deeply into the Hero it just has to be
something to start the game off with a kick.


## Starting Resources

## Favor

Favor can be used to power Edges. It can also be used
as ad hoc Boons. At any time a Player can spend Favor
and name a Boon and the Hero has that Boon for one
die roll. The player can spend up to 3 Favor to get a +3
Boon, however he is still limited to the Boons the
character could buy with x The character couldn’t
spend Favor to get a +3d sword, because sword as a
Boon has a max value of +1d (Common Gear).

A player can also spend a point of Favor to appear in
scene or bring someone else into a scene they are in. At
anytime a player can spend Favor, create a flimsy
excuse and appear in a scene. If they are already in a
scene and they want to bring someone else in, they
spend a point of Favor, again make a flimsy excuse and
that person enters the scene.

## Logos

Logos is used by the demiurge, not the hero. It
allows the the demiurge to introduce a
background element into creation. Logos can be used to
establish Campaign Facts or create Quest Cards (See
above).

A demiurege can have a maximum number of Logos
equal to 3 plus half the largest face on his hero’s
Possibility Attribute Pool (i.e. 5 for d4, 6 for d6, 7 for
d8).

Each demiurge starts the campaign with their
maximum Logos. They can never exceed this.

## Quest Card

Each player also starts the campaign with one free
Quest Card (see Quest Cards above).




---


## Bonuses

Each Hero receives a free Key, Edge and Quest Card
(See Below). Those should be based on the answers to
the above questions.
Favor

Each hero is connected to the demiurge in ways that
are beyond explaining. Although the Hero is unaware
of the demiurge, the Demiurge is aware of the Hero
and grants the Hero Favor and gains status as the
Hero advances to completion of his story.

Each Hero begins with 2 points of Favor. The Hero
gains more Favor by exploring the creation of the
demiurges, fulfilling a Demiurge’s boasts and by being
true to the Hero’s nature (hitting his Keys).

Favor can be used to put a Hero into a scene, use a
Boon the Hero doesn’t have, activate Props and power
Edges. Keys, Boons, Props and Edges will be
explained below.
