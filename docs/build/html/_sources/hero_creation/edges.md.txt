# Edges

Edges are ways in which a Hero can bend the rules under specific
circumstances.  These are not {{metaphysics}}, those are covered by 
[Boons](boons/boons.md), often as [Talents](boons/talents.md) exploiting 
metaphysics facts which 
are intrinsic to the campaign world.

An edge has three parts: **Name**, **Description** and **Mechanics**.
Name and description are descriptions of the Edge and will imply
when it can apply.  The description should limit an edge in some
way, it should not be able to be used in all situations. 

Some of the Edge Blueprints will require that the Edge be 
limited to {{Strategies}} where a particular Boon is being 
used.  Even those Edges that don't have such a requirement 
should be limited to a particular kind of challenge; 
physical, mental, spiritual, social, athletic, etc.

Mechanics is the Edge Blueprint adjusted or with specifics 
filled in to 
fit the description.  All Edges should be made in consultation
with the group and GM and everyone should agree that it is 
appropriately limited in scope. 

**The Hero starts with one free edge and can purchase
additional Edges for 5xp each.**

## Using an Edge

All Edges require the expenditure of one or more {{Favor}}
to activate them.  There may be particular situations that 
exactly match an Edge's description and the GM may allow them 
to be activated for free.  

The GM can always award arbitrary [Favor](../tools/currency.md#favor), 
and this is just a case 
of them awarding Favor conditioned on the Hero activating their 
Edge. 

Edges generally can be used at any time that its conditions
are met.  Many Edges need an 
Attribute Roll to actually act on, but they can be 
used before or after that roll, and if it makes sense for the 
Edge they may be used during other Heroes rolls, or if an 
Edge doesn't need an Attribute Roll, it can be used whenever.

## Edge Blueprints

There are a finite number of Edge Blueprints that can be adjusted 
or completed into an infinite number of possible edges, each applicable
to different situations and in different 
[Strategies](../play/challenge.md#strategy).


{.small}
### Attribute Blueprints

These Blueprints typically influence Attribute Rolls under 
certain circumstances.

* During a particular kind of challenge, 
if a Hero pays a Favor, the Hero adds one level of advantage to each
attribute, even if there is no appropriate Boon.
* During a particular kind of challenge, 
if a Hero pays a Favor, an attribute, 
chosen when the Edge is bought, 
can't roll less than 2x the level of advantage.
* During a particular kind of complex challenge, if the Hero 
rolls a failure or worse on their Attribute Roll, they may
spend a Favor and add a level of advantage to all their attributes.
Each subsequent roll they fail, 
they add an additional level of {{advantage}} to 
each attribute until they succeed, or choose not to engage with the challenge.
If the Hero chooses not to engage, or succeeds at an attribute roll, their 
advantage levels return to normal. 



{.small}
### Boon Blueprints

These Blueprint often require a specific [Boon](boons/boons.md) 
be used in a 
[Strategy](../play/challenge.md#strategy) 
to be able to use them or influences Attribute Rolls
using a particular Boon.

* The Hero pays a Favor when making an Attribute Roll that includes
a particular Boon in a specific circumstance or situation,
and gains x2 level of [advantage](boons/boons.md#tiers) from that Boon.
* When using a specific Boon in a particular circumstance, and a Hero
rolls at least a [tie](../play/challenge.md#effect), they may increase the level of 
success by one level (tie to success 
or success to critical success).
* When using a specific Boon in a particular circumstance, and a Hero
rolls a [failure](../play/challenge.md#effect) 
or worse, they may increase the level of 
success by one level (critical failure to failure, failure to tie).
* When making an Attribute Roll that includes a specific Boon, a 
Hero may spend a Favor and reduce the [Blood or Stress](../play/consequences.md#stress--blood) by one.
* When making an Attribute Roll that includes a specific Boon, a 
Hero may spend a Favor and ignore the effect of Wounds or Trauma
(chosen when the Edge is purchased) for the remainder of the 
scene.  At the end of the scene the Hero receives an additional 
Wound or Trauma (chosen when the Edge is purchased) that can't be 
recovered by [First Aid](../play/consequences.md#first-aid).

### Resource Blueprints

These Blueprints let a Hero get more out of their resources, but tend to 
constrain what the Hero can do with those resources. 
These Blueprints may not be used
in any way by themselves or in combination with other Edges or other Heroes
that can be said to generate infinite resources.

* Spend a Favor, and get two [Favor](../tools/currency.md#favor) 
to spend in a specific way.  The Favor 
must be spent by the end of the scene, or it is lost. 
This Favor may not be used in any way that generates any further Favor.
* Spend a Favor, and gain two dice that can added to 
pools under constrained circumstances, such as having to be given to 
other Heroes or something similarly limited. 
If the dice are not used by the end of the challenge, they are lost.
Each die increases the level of advantage for a single attribute 
during an Attribute Roll.
No more than two dice may be added per attribute roll in this way.
* The Hero can spend a Favor and be able to perform a Wound or 
Trauma [recovery roll](../play/consequences.md#first-aid) 
(specified at purchase). 
The recover roll could be used by the Hero or granted to another
depending on the Edge description.
No Hero can benefit from this more than once per scene.


{.small}
### Pain Blueprints

These Blueprints influence the Pain Pool, usually reducing it by 
either dice or a set number. 

* During a particular type of [challenge](../play/challenge.md), 
a Hero may spend a Favor and 
reduce the pain pool by 1 die.  This persists for the remainder of 
the challenge.  This may only be done once per challenge and cannot 
reduce the pain pool below 3 dice. 
* During a particular type of challenge, a Hero may spend a one or more 
Favor and 
reduce the pain pool by 1 for each Favor spent for 
the pain pool's next (or current) roll.




## Custom Edges

If a Player wants an Edge for their Hero that they don't feel can 
be built by the existing Blueprints, and is approximately of the same
impact level of the existing Blueprints, they are 
invited to propose new mechanics for blueprints for the group's and 
the GM's consideration.  

The GM is under no obligation to make something for them, only to 
consider their proposals and hopefully work with them to find 
something that works.
