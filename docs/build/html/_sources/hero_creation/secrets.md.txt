# Secrets

Secrets are the stunts, gifts and/or powers of
Gnosis. They are the ways in which a particular
Hero bends the rules to their advantage.

(GDNote: This is is rough and probably needs to be
balanced. Just because you can make it with the system
doesn’t mean I’ll let you have it. This includes
retroactively taking it away.)

Each Secret has a Benefit, possibly a Modifier and a
Price. The Benefit and Modifier must be balanced by
the Price. (e.g. if the Hero has a Secret with a +3
Benefit, he must have Prices totaling at least -3). If the
secret has aBenefit+Modifier 4 or greater it must
include that it costs a point of favor to activate.

The xp cost of a Secret is equal to the Benefit +
Modifier values. Any additional Price beyond what is
required to balance Benefit and Modifier reduces the
total cost of the Secret. The xp cost of the Secret can’t
be reduced by more than half.

Each Secret needs a name and color text. The name
and color text will be used to determine if the Secret
applies in any given situation.

Each character starts with one free Secret that can cost
no more than 4 xp.
