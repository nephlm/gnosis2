# Secrets

Secrets are ways in which a Hero can bend the rules under specific
circumstances.  These are not {{metaphysics}}, those are covered by 
{{Boons}} in general and [Talents](boons/talents.md) specifically 
and are intrinsic to the campaign world, while secrets are specific 
to a particular Hero.

## Name and Color Text

There are only a finite number of things a Secret can mechanically do, but 
there are infinite possibilities on what color text goes with the mechanical
effects, and it is the color text that determines if Secret can apply in 
a given circumstance.  

Each Secret has a name and a sentence or two of color text.  The name and 
color text would define when a Secret could be used with a {{Strategy}}.

There is a high likelihood that the name and color text of the Secret
closely bind it to one of the Hero's Boons.  The names of Secrets
could very well be {{Boons}}.

* Ancestral Crafting
    * The Hero can channel the Ancestral knowledge of their craft 
    masters and all those that came before them to create masterwork 
    craftings. 
    * The Hero can spend a Favor while attempting an attribute roll to craft 
    something and add an additional level of advantage to one of their 
    attributes.
* Hellfire Burn
    * The Hero can infuse their flames with the power of Hell which 
    clings to any touched by it.
    * When the Hero rolls a success on a {{Strategy}} that includes their
    *Fire Blast* Talent, they can spend a Favor and turn it into a 
    Critical Success.

## What is a Secret

## Color text of a Secret

## Using a Secret


## 

Secrets usually cost a favor to use.

* +1 level of advantage on a boon
* If a challenge fails, spend a favor and on the next roll each pool gains an additional level of advantage.  Each failure adds a level of advantage to all pools until the character succeeds at the challenge or the challenge is resolved.

* -1 die from the pain pool (min 3 dice)
* -1 from pain pool result
  * Much higher impact on big pain pools.  Is that okay?

* Spend a favor, get two favor to spend on other character's behalf
* Spend a favor, gain two dice that can be given to another character and added to pools.
  * No more than one per challenge.
* Spend a favor and get two flashbacks.  Can be used by the character or passed to another character.  Don't have to be used immediately, but do have to be used by the end of the scene.

* A selected stat always has at least one level of advantage, even if there is no appropriate Boon.
* A selected stat can't roll less than the level of advantage

* When using a selected Boon, spend a favor to shift the result from success to critical success.
* Spend a favor downshift a failure
  * from crit failure to failure, and from failure to draw

* Spend 2 favor, heal a boon
  * The one to activate the secret, plus one additional one.
* Advantage on recovery/healing rolls








Secrets are the stunts, gifts and/or powers of
Gnosis. They are the ways in which a particular
Hero bends the rules to their advantage.

(GDNote: This is is rough and probably needs to be
balanced. Just because you can make it with the system
doesn’t mean I’ll let you have it. This includes
retroactively taking it away.)

Each Secret has a Benefit, possibly a Modifier and a
Price. The Benefit and Modifier must be balanced by
the Price. (e.g. if the Hero has a Secret with a +3
Benefit, he must have Prices totaling at least -3). If the
secret has aBenefit+Modifier 4 or greater it must
include that it costs a point of favor to activate.

The xp cost of a Secret is equal to the Benefit +
Modifier values. Any additional Price beyond what is
required to balance Benefit and Modifier reduces the
total cost of the Secret. The xp cost of the Secret can’t
be reduced by more than half.

Each Secret needs a name and color text. The name
and color text will be used to determine if the Secret
applies in any given situation.

Each character starts with one free Secret that can cost
no more than 4 xp.
