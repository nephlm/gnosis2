# Quests

The [Hero](../hero_creation/character_creation.md) 
completing acts of significance to the Story grants 
the [demiurge](demiurge.md) influence over creation.
Creation of story is what the Story considered acts of 
Significance.

The demiurge may spend a point of [Logos](demiurge.md) 
and boast to
the Story the things his hero will do. In game this
boast is represented by the quest card. A quest card
consists of three things:

```{sidebar} Possible Rewards:

* a point of Favor
* a point of Logos 
* Prop
* A contact
* 1 xp specific Boon
* 1 xp
* 2 xp specific Boon
* 2 xp
* 3 xp specific Boon
* 3 xp
* Combination of the above
```

* A title
* A specific thing that must be accomplished to
complete the quest
* A reward for completing the quest

The GM may create a quest card without expenditure
of Logos, but they are discouraged from doing so. 
The GM should not force the players to be interested in
something that aren't interested in.

A demiurge can
create a Quest Card at any time, however the Story is
dismissive of boasts of obvious events and offers no or
minimal rewards for such boasts.

The player whose demiurge spends the Logos specifies
the title and quest, the GM specifies the reward. 
The Story is unimpressed with boasts that a Hero will 
cross the street.

Any worthy quests should reward a Logos in addition to 
any other rewards.

Quest Cards can be either individual, party or group It
will depend on the specific quest and how it is
accomplished. 


Quest cards are the only way to get xp and thus for characters 
to advance.  During Hero creation, Players create one free
quest.
