# Quests

How does a Hero advance without accomplishing great 
deeds?  How does a Hero fulfill their destiny and 
have a great character arc?  The answer is Quests.

The player through their role as Demiurge, give the 
Hero a Quest, by giving it a cool name, and a specific
thing that must be accomplished.  

Besides the role of quests in Hero advancement they 
serve the much larger purposed in telegraphing to 
the table and the GM, what the Hero will be trying
to accomplish over the next session or two.  

It's not uncommon for Heroes to pick up very large
over arching Quests to communicate their 
campaign goals, 
as well as smaller goals showing what they wish to 
accomplish in the next session or two and 
to advance as a Hero. 

```{admonition} Example Quests

hotel's wine cellar.

Special Skills

### Rewards

If the Hero is successful, they are rewarded.  This
reward may many things, but importantly **Quests are the 
only way for a Hero to gain {{xp}}**, which they can 
spend on [Boons](boons/boons.md) and [Edges](edges).



```{sidebar} Possible Rewards:

* Prop / contact / Kit Gear
* a point of Favor
* a point of Logos 
* 1 xp specific Boon
* 1 xp
* 2 xp specific Boon
* 2 xp
* Combination of the above
```

Quests can be large or small, but should probably 
be at least a session's worth of effort. 
Less than that and 
the rewards may be non-existent or at least less 
than the Demiurge paid for the quest. 

**Quests cost a Logos for each quest, and each 
Hero starts with one Quest for free.** Initial 
Quests often relate to a Hero's {{Trouble}} or 
what [just happened](checklist.md) before 
the beginning of play.

* Only Quests that aren't worthy of the Hero won't 
Reward a Logos in combination with any other 
Rewards.  Not receiving Logos is a message that the 
Quest wasn't worthy.

    Quests that don't inform the GM what the Hero 
    intends before they actually do it, are usually
    considered unworthy.

* A Prop, Contact and Kit Gear are usually incidental
rewards or opportunities the Hero can choose to 
spend xp on a later.  

    A Hero who wants a 
    *Magic Sword* may make a Quest and go after such a 
    sword, and if successful be granted a Prop or Kit Gear 
    version of a magic sword in addition to any xp, giving 
    them the opportunity to start investing into the 
    *Magic Sword* Boon. 
    
* Experience points can only be earned by completing Quests.

The GM is responsible for choosing the Reward.  They may set 
it when the Quest is acquired or more commonly when it is 
completed once it is revealed how worthy the Quest became.

Players must create Quests to gain xp, the GM should not create
Quests under normal circumstances. 


Quest Cards can be either individual, party or group It
will depend on the specific quest and how it is
accomplished.  It's often not possible to know whether 
an individual, party or group reward is appropriate 
for a Quest until it's revealed how the Quest is 
accomplished.
