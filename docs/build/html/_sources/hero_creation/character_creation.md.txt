# Making a Hero


```{image} ../_static/hero.jpg
```

In addition to the {{Demiurge}} which exist outside of
{{Creation}}, each player also has a Hero. The Hero is
connected to the Demiurge, though since Creation isn’t
even aware of the existence of the Demiurges, the Hero
certainly isn’t either.

It is the player’s responsibility to make the Hero's 
existence in Creation make a more interesting story. 
Interesting Heroes get more spotlight time.
Although we call the Hero a hero,
depending on the campaign they may be more or less
heroic to downright unpleasant.

If you already know the difference between 
an {{Edge}} and a {{Talent}}, the 
[Hero Creation Checklist](checklist.md)
contains the steps and numbers without
the explanation.

## High Concept

The first thing to choose is the Hero's High Concept.
This pithy short phrase encapsulates the Hero's 
nature.  This is how the other players describe the 
Hero when they can't remember their name. 

Any source of metaphysical power should be part 
of the high concept.  It could be entirely that, but 
the high concept is usually better with an adjective
or something more than a generic practitioner of some
metaphysical art.

It could be a job title or a responsibility.  This is
the core nature of the Hero.  It is what they *do*
and what they *are* rolled together.

The High Concept becomes a free tier 1 
[Talent](boons/talents.md).

## Trouble

```{sidebar} Sample Troubles

Owe the Mob  
Hand of Justice  
Chosen of Excalibur  
Magic Addict  
Obsessive Collector  
Lost Family  
Vicious Rival  
Hunter and Hunted  
Prophesied Protector  
Terrified Seer  
```


The Heroes are talented individuals with a lot of potential
at the least, and probably power.  They could stay at home 
and work a cushy 9-to-5 and do well for themselves.

But they don't.

Why not?  What is wrong with them, that causes them to find 
themselves in *interesting* situations time and time again. This 
might be something that they believe in, or fight for.
It might be a mistake they made the in the past. 
Whatever it is, there is no simple solution or way to avoid it by 
hiding at home.  It forces the Hero out in the world and 
into trouble. 

Like the High Concept this should short, pithy and
encapsulates what gets the Hero in trouble.

## Core Questions

In addition to High Concept and Trouble, there are 
other questions to consider while constructing the core
of the Hero.  

### What’s on the Surface?

What does the Hero look like, what do they appear be.
What assumptions do people make by looking at them?
Who would be cast to play them in a movie? 

This is where we ask species, gender, height and all
the surface level things that will have impacted the 
Hero as they became adults... or are they still a kid?

### What is the Hero’s Vice?

What is the Hero’s weakness that drives him to make
poor decisions? Everyone has a blind spot that they
may or may not be aware of. What is your Hero’s
blind spot. 

A good vice drives the Hero forward into a
brick wall with great verve and enthusiasm. Try to
avoid your tactical mind to create meaningless vices,
it’ll make your Hero less fun and thus give you less
spotlight time.

Vices are not always things that are considered 
traditional vices like addiction, gambling, pornography, 
etc.  If the Hero makes bad decisions about their family, 
they might be the Hero's vice.  A paladin's oath may be 
their vice if they put it before their own survival.

### What Holds Your Hero Here?

The Hero can go anywhere, why are they **here**?
What is the Hero's baggage?

There is another planet just 116 light-years away,
barely a skip and a jump, but the Hero can't leave
this planet. 
What makes this place the home they can't abandon, no 
matter what trouble comes? 
What ties of honor, family, duty or hatred ensure that
your Hero still has unfinished business here. 

For
campaigns of global (universal/interdimensional)
scope this question may not apply, for others, *here*
might be quite large indeed.
