# Starting Resources

## Favor

Favor can be used to power Secrets. It can also be used
as ad hoc Boons. At any time a Player can spend Favor
and name a Boon and the Hero has that Boon for one
die roll. The player can spend up to 3 Favor to get a +3
Boon, however he is still limited to the Boons the
character could buy with x The character couldn’t
spend Favor to get a +3d sword, because sword as a
Boon has a max value of +1d (Common Gear).

A player can also spend a point of Favor to appear in
scene or bring someone else into a scene they are in. At
anytime a player can spend Favor, create a flimsy
excuse and appear in a scene. If they are already in a
scene and they want to bring someone else in, they
spend a point of Favor, again make a flimsy excuse and
that person enters the scene.

## Logos

Logos is used by the demiurge, not the hero. It
allows the the demiurge to introduce a
background element into creation. Logos can be used to
establish Campaign Facts or create Quest Cards (See
above).

A demiurege can have a maximum number of Logos
equal to 3 plus half the largest face on his hero’s
Possibility Attribute Pool (i.e. 5 for d4, 6 for d6, 7 for
d8).

Each demiurge starts the campaign with their
maximum Logos. They can never exceed this.

## Quest Card

Each player also starts the campaign with one free
Quest Card (see Quest Cards above).
