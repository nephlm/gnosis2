## Boons/Character

* Clarify Network levels
  * Network people are of a given level whether they are contacts, allies or companions.
    * You can't buy a level 1 mob boss, that would be the neighborhood drug dealer.
    * You can upgrade the relationship, but the level of the boon won't change unless the person's position does.

## Secrets

Secrets usually cost a favor to use.

* +1 level of advantage on a boon
* If a challenge fails, spend a favor and on the next roll each pool gains an additional level of advantage.  Each failure adds a level of advantage to all pools until the character succeeds at the challenge or the challenge is resolved.

* -1 die from the pain pool (min 3 dice)
* -1 from pain pool result
  * Much higher impact on big pain pools.  Is that okay?

* Spend a favor, get two favor to spend on other character's behalf
* Spend a favor, gain two dice that can be given to another character and added to pools.
  * No more than one per challenge.
* Spend a favor and get two flashbacks.  Can be used by the character or passed to another character.  Don't have to be used immediately, but do have to be used by the end of the scene.

* A selected stat always has at least one level of advantage, even if there is no appropriate Boon.
* A selected stat can't roll less than the level of advantage

* When using a selected Boon, spend a favor to shift the result from success to critical success.
* Spend a favor downshift a failure
  * from crit failure to failure, and from failure to draw

* Spend 2 favor, heal a boon
  * The one to activate the secret, plus one additional one.
* Advantage on recovery/healing rolls

    * Trivial tasks can be done without spending a favor.
  * Flashback entails success at a challenge.
