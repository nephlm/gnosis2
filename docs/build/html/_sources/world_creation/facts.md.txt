# Setting Facts

Before moving on to the next stage of setting 
creation, let's discuss 
Setting Facts.

A setting is largely defined by its setting facts. 
For something to be a *True Fact* about a setting
someone must write it down in whatever your group
chooses to use as a setting {{bible}}.


```{admonition} Fact Parts
A fact is made up of three parts:

:**Fact**: The fact being established in the setting.
:**Price**: A counterbalancing fact in the setting that balances the fact that
is being established.
:**Player**: The player who created the fact.  The player is important because they get rewarded the first few
times the fact comes up in play.  
```


## Logos

A setting fact has a [Price](#price), and a cost in currency.  The Price is the 
permanent countering fact, while the cost is the 
{{Logos}} that a 
player must spend to make the fact **True**.

A player may spend [Logos](../tools/currency.md#logos) 
at any time to establish a 
fact as true.  Until a player spends Logos on a fact it
isn't actually true within the setting.  This doesn't mean 
that it's false, just that the truth of the fact is undefined.


Narratively, it is the {{Demiurges}} that establish the facts
in creation, and Demiurges are imperfect, and thus, so are 
their creations.  This imperfection manifests itself as the 
Price.

The Price is another associated fact with a 
similar scope that generally 
balances the created fact.  If the fact gave powers to vampires,
the Price will strengthen, or create the Templars that 
hunt them. 






```{admonition} Some sample facts:

```{hlist} 
:columns: 2


* Aliens interfered with human evolution in
ancient times.
* Psionic characters can exert physical force with the power
of their minds.
* Necromancers use human sacrifice to power their
spells.
* Elemental spirits live in large fires.
* The government runs death squads hunting down
supernaturals.
* Common citizens fear mages.
```

## Breadth of Facts

Setting facts are best if they are narrowly defined, 
so there is a limit on how broad a fact may be.



Facts should be limited to a single distinct quality or
description about a single group or entity. The exact
breadth of facts the players around the table are
comfortable with will become clear early on in the
game.

When a fact whisks a noun into existence, it is often
done implicitly, with the first quality. The fact,
“*Mages cast spells*”, implicitly creates mages and the 
existence of magic. It is possible to explicitly create
mages, “*Mages exist.*”, but it isn’t necessary or even
desirable.




Generally, facts shouldn’t have conjunctions. Look
very closely at facts containing *and*, *yet*, *or*, *so*,
*but*, *for* or *nor*. Are they really a single fact, or
should they really be considered two or more facts
costing additional Logos and incurring additional
Prices?


A fact can't remove something that has already been established 
by previous fact or fiction.  A character can't spend a Logos
and remove the mage's guild that had been established earlier, but 
they may create a new ally or vulnerability of the guild.

## Price

When a Demiurge expends
{{Logos}} to reorder {{Creation}}, Creation becomes
unbalanced. Unintended facts are introduced into
Creation in order to stabilize it.

The Prices always work counter to the interests to the
entity that benefited from the original fact. Prices can
be organizations that work at cross purposes or 
a related weakness or vulnerability.

Creating an Order of Paladins
dedicated to Law and Order may have a Price of the
existence of an organized crime syndicate or corruption
in the leadership of the paladins.  Generally it 
will be something the bolsters Chaos and Corruption.


The Demiurge of a vampire Hero spends
Logos, to establish that vampires are tough as nails. 
In order to
balance creation, a Price such as ‘Templars are
dedicated to killing all vampires’, ‘vampires must suck
blood nightly’, ‘vampires can’t function in sunlight’ or
‘vampires are vulnerable to silver’ is added to creation.

```{admonition} Example Prices

:The police are corrupt: There is a robust community of vigilantes.

:Fallen Angels can craft Relics from collected souls: The ethics 
and morality of the souls influence how the Relics behave. 

:The Mages Guild is benevolent:  They are opposed by 
freelance mages out for personal power.

```

The Price should never invalidate the fact.  It should either 
be orthogonal to the fact or a **Yes, and...** sort of response
to the fact that adds complexity to it. 

Also see [](../tools/credibility.md) for how the table can keep 
Facts from making the setting inconsistent.

### Balancing Scopes

One thing to watch for is to ensure that the scopes of the 
fact and the Price are matched.  It is fine to have large vague 
facts, but they should be matched with equally large 
Prices.  

A fact creating all the vampire's traditional weaknesses, 
must also have an equally broad Price, encompassing 
many powers, maybe all the traditional vampire powers.

What are traditional powers and weaknesses are left for
the individual table to decide, and is why narrow facts
are often preferred.

### Setting The Price

Any
player can and should suggest Prices, but ultimately
only one player gets to decide. 

* If the campaign fact is
created by a player Demiurge, the GM gets to be the
final arbiter of the Price. 
* If the Demiurge that creates
the fact is controlled by the GM, each player rolls a
die, and the highest number
gets to decide on the
first Price for the session. 
    * The responsibility moves clockwise around
the table for the remainder of the session.

The {{Demiurge}} spending the {{Logos}}, can refuse to pay the 
Price, and the fact isn't established.  Generally the 
players should all work together to find a Price that
can be paid.

This is a cooperative game where everyone is trying to 
create an engaging and interesting story together, 
so like any situation, the Price
is a negotiation with the goal of both sides to create
the most interesting world to play in.

## Reward

The first three (3) times a Campaign Fact is used, 
the {{Hero}} of the {{Demiurge}} that 
created the fact, gains a point of [Favor](../tools/currency.md#favor).

This is only for facts created by
player Demiurges, not for the Price associated with 
those facts.  

After receiving three favor for a given fact, the
Demiurge receives a point of [Logos](../tools/currency.md#logos) and the 
Hero no longer gains Favor when the fact appears 
in the game.

## GM Facts

The players aren’t the only Demiurges with their
fingers in {{Creation}}. The GM has a pool of Logos they
can spend to modify Creation just as a Demiurge would.

The GM has 2 Logos per player to use each session, though 
the GM is encouraged to use the Prices for player facts to 
establish what they would like.

## Assumed Facts

After the game has been going on for a few sessions, 
the group may realize that they all have been acting like
some fact has been established, though in fact it has not.

The GM can either clarify that it has not been established, 
and thus someone could create a counter-fact, or write it 
down with the list of facts and move on. 

It's usually not necessary to establish that gravity exists 
in most campaigns, and most GMs would take it as an assumed 
fact along with causality and all the usual laws of physics, 
unless someone tried to pay Logos and establish that it 
doesn't.

The sorts of facts that break play expectations about the 
usual laws of physics, should probably be brought up during the 
pitch session not several sessions into the game.

## Disowned Facts

Sometimes a Fact a player created doesn't end up front and 
center in campaign, and a player needs the  
[Logos](../tools/currency.md#logos) they invested in the Fact.

If all the following are true, a Fact may be disowned:

* The Fact has existed for three session.
* The Fact hasn't come up in the current or previous session.
* The Fact hasn't come up three times in play.

Disowning a fact can happen at any time during a session that 
meets the above criteria.  Once a fact has been disowned, it 
acts forever more as if it was a GM Fact, and the player
receives no more Favor if it were to come up in the future.

In exchange for disowning the Fact, the player gets the 
Logos they spent on it back.  The 
Logos can be saved or spent immediately.
