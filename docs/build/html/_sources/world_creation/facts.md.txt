# Creating Facts

In Gnosis the world is built and metaphysics established
by spending [Logos](demiurge.md) to establish a fact.

* A player or the GM may spend a Logos
to establish a fact in the campaign at any time. 
* New facts
may not contradict existing facts, though they may
narrow or clarify existing facts. 
* All facts have a price, a balancing fact.
* The fact is associated with the player.

Narratively, it is the demiurges that establish the facts
in creation, and demiurges are imperfect, and thus, so are 
their creations.  This imperfection manifests itself as the 
price.

The price is another associated fact with a 
similar scope that generally 
balances the created fact.  If the fact gave powers to vampires,
the price will strengthen, or create the Templars that 
hunt them. 

## Limits

A fact can't remove something that has already been established 
previous fact or fiction.  A character can't spend a Logos
and remove the mage's guild that had been established earlier, but 
they may create a new ally or enemy of the guild.






## Breadth of Facts

When a fact whisks a noun into existence, it is often
done implicitly, with the first quality. The fact,
“Mages cast spells”, implicitly creates mages if they did
not already exist. It is possible to explicitly create
mages, “Mages exist.”, but it isn’t necessary or even
desirable.

Facts should be limited to a single distinct quality or
description about a single group or entity. The exact
breadth of facts the players around the table are
comfortable with will become clear early on in the
game.

```{sidebar} Some sample facts:

* Aliens interfered with human evolution in
ancient times.
* Psionics can exert physical force with the power
of their minds.
* Necromancers use human sacrifice to power their
spells.
* Elemental spirits live in large fires.
* The government runs death squads hunting down
supernaturals.
* Common citizens fear mages.
```

Generally, facts shouldn’t have conjunctions. Look
very closely at facts containing 'and', 'yet', 'or', 'so',
'but', 'for' or 'nor'. Are they really a single fact, or
should they really be considered two or more facts
costing additional Logos and incurring additional
prices?

Campaign Facts come in two broad categories:
Metaphysics and Setting. 


### Metaphysics

Metaphysics are facts
that allow vampires to exist and sorcerers to cast spells
and necromancers to raise the dead. Until someone
spends a point of Logos to establish these facts, they
aren’t true (or more precisely, they are undefined).

Metaphysics aren’t just about magic, the breadth and
reach of technology in a science fiction campaign are
also defined by Metaphysics.

### Setting

Setting facts introduce organizations, kingdoms and
relationships into the game world. They can be used to
establish the existence of the thieves’ guild, a wizard’s
council, a royal dynasty, etc. 

Generally Logos doesn’t
have to be spent to make a person exist, but the GM
or the players can give that person specific qualities by
spending Logos, as long as it doesn't change established 
facts or narrative.

No one has to spend
Logos for an arch wizard to exist, however, someone
had to spend Logos to establish an organization that
can have an arch wizard.






## Price

When a demiurge expends
Logos to reorder creation, creation becomes
unbalanced. Unintended facts are introduced into
creation in order to stabilize it.

Creating an Order of Paladins
dedicated to Law and Order may have a price of the
existence of an organized crime syndicate or corruption
in the leadership of the paladins.

The prices always work counter to the interests to the
entity that benefited from the original fact. Prices can
be organizations that work at cross purposes, 
a related weakness or vulnerability.

The demiurge of a vampire hero spends
Logos, to establish that vampires are tough as nails. 
In order to
balance creation, a price such as ‘Templars are
dedicated to killing all vampires’, ‘vampires must suck
blood nightly’, ‘vampires can’t function in sunlight’ or
‘vampires are vulnerable to silver’ is added to creation.

```{admonition} Balancing Scopes
:class: seealso

One thing to watch for is to ensure that the scopes of the 
fact and the price are matched.  It is fine to have large vague 
facts, but if so they should be matched with equally large 
prices.  

A fact creating all the vampire's traditional weaknesses, 
must also give have a equally broad price, encompassing 
many powers, maybe all the traditional vampire powers.

What are traditional powers and weaknesses are left for
the individual table to decide. 
```

### Setting The Price

Any
player can and should suggest prices, but ultimately
only one player gets to decide. 

* If the campaign fact is
created by a player demiurge, the GM gets to be the
final arbiter of the price. 
* If the demiurge that creates
the fact is controlled by the GM, the player with a
demiurge with the most Logos gets to decide on the
first price. 
    * The responsibility move clockwise around
the table for the remainder of the session.

The demiurge spending the Logos, can refuse to pay the 
price, and the fact isn't established.  Generally the 
players should all work together to find a price that
can be paid.

This is a cooperative game where everyone is trying to 
create an engaging and interesting story, 
so like any situation, the price
is a negotiation.


## Reward

The first 3 times a Campaign Fact is used, the player that 
created the fact, gains a point of favor.

This is only for facts created by
player demiurges, not for the price associated with 
those facts.  

After receiving three favor for a given fact, the
demiurge receives a point of Logos.

## GM Facts

The players aren’t the only demiurges with their
fingers in creation. The GM has a pool of Logos he
can spend to modify creation just as a demiurge would.

The GM has 2 Logos per player to use each session, though 
the GM is encouraged to use the prices for player prices to 
establish what they would like.

## Assumed Facts

After the game has been going on for a few sessions, 
the group may realize that they all have been acting like
some fact has been established, though in fact it has not.

The GM can either clarify that it has not been established, 
and thus someone could create a counter-fact, or write it 
down with the list of facts and move on.
