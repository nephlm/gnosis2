# Creating Facts

A player or the GM can spend a point of Logos
and establish a fact in the campaign. New facts
can not contradict existing facts, though they may
narrow or clarify existing facts. For example if the
existence of a ubiquitous order of paladins had been
established through expenditure of Logos. A campaign
fact stating that they don’t exist couldn’t be
established. However, a fact that they are not welcome
and thus uncommon and weak in the Kingdom
Vanosh could be established.

Campaign Facts come in two broad categories:
Metaphysics and Setting. Metaphysics are the facts
that allow vampires to exist and sorcerers to cast spells
and necromancers to raise the dead. Until someone
spends a point of Logos to establish these facts, they
aren’t true (or more precisely, they are undefined).
Metaphysics aren’t just about magic, the breadth and
reach of technology in a science fiction campaign are
also defined by Metaphysics.

Setting facts introduce organizations, kingdoms and
relationships into the game world. They can be used to
establish the existence of the thieves’ guild, a wizard’s
council, a royal dynasty, etc. Generally Logos doesn’t
have to be spent to make a person exist, but the GM
or the players can give that person specific qualities by
spending Logos. For example no one has to spend
Logos for an arch wizard to exist, however, someone
had to spend Logos to establish an organization that
can have an arch wizard and someone can spend a
additional Logos to make him sympathetic to the
foreign dignitaries. Though as we’ll learn later, there is
a price for this.

The players aren’t the only demiurges with their
fingers in creation. The GM has a pool of Logos he
can spend to modify creation just as a demiurge would.

## Breadth of Facts

Facts should be limited to a single distinct quality or
description about a single group or entity. The exact
breadth of facts the players around the table are
comfortable with will become clear early on in the
game.

Some sample facts:

* Aliens interfered with human evolution in the
ancient times.
* Psionics can exert physical force with the power
of their minds.
* Necromancers use human sacrifice to power their
spells.
* Elemental spirits live in large fires.
* The government runs death squads hunting down
supernaturals.
* Common citizens fear mages.

Generally, facts shouldn’t have conjunctions. Look
very closely at facts containing 'and', 'yet', 'or', 'so',
'but', 'for' or 'nor'. Are they really a single fact or
should they really be considered two or more facts
costing additional Logos and incurring additional
prices?

When a noun is first whisked into existence it is often
done implicitly with the first quality. The fact,
“Mages cast spells”, implicitly creates mages if they did
not already exist. It is possible to explicitly create
mages, “Mages exist.”, but it isn’t necessary or even
desired. Except for that one implicit
element generally facts contain only a single element.

## Price

Since the demiurges lack the scope and majesty of the
Story and their creations are bound into matter and
spirit, their creations are imperfect. This imperfection
manifests as the Price. When a demiurge expends
Logos to reorder creation, creation becomes
unbalanced. Unintended facts are introduced into
creation in order to stabilize it.

With every fact that is created, there is a counter fact
created. For example, creating an Order of Paladins
dedicated to Law and Order may have a price of the
existence of an organized crime syndicate or corruption
in the leadership of the paladins.

The prices always work counter to the interests to the
entity that benefited from the original fact. Prices can
be organizations that work at cross purposes,
limitations of applicability or a related weakness or
vulnerability.

For example the demiurge of a vampire hero spends
Logos, so vampires are tough as nails. In order to
balance creation, a price such as ‘Templars are
dedicated to killing all vampires’, ‘vampires must suck
blood nightly’, ‘vampires can’t function in sunlight’ or
‘vampires are vulnerable to silver’ is added to creation.

The demiurge spending the Logos, can retract the
Logos after coming to understand the price. Any
player can and should suggest prices, but ultimately
only one player gets to decide. If the campaign fact is
created by a player demiurge, the GM gets to be the
final arbiter of the price. If the demiurge that creates
the fact is controlled by the GM, the player with a
demiruge with the most Logos gets to decide on the
first price. The responsibility move clockwise around
the table for subsequent prices.

## Reward

The first 3 times a Campaign Fact that was created by
a player demiurge comes into play, the demiurge’s hero
gains a point of Favor. This is only for facts created by
player demiurges, not for Prices. This reward applies
to both Metaphysics and Setting Facts.

Every 3 Favor the Hero receives in this way, the
demiurge receives a point of Logos.
