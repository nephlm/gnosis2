# Intial World Creation

As just mentioned each player starts with a
number of Logos, but don’t worry about that
yet. For now each player who will be making a
character has 3 Logos that must be spent. Two of them
must be spent to establish Setting Facts and one which
must be spent on Metaphysics.

If the GM wants he can claim his 3 tokens as well, but
since he’ll be setting the price on all the player facts it
is hardly necessary. It’s time to go back to the list of
facts that were probably generated when you were
unpacking the pitch. They are up for bid.

Make sure they conform the breadth of facts listed
above. You may find it necessary to break up facts into
several smaller facts to conform to the breadth rules.
Any facts that either no one wants to buy, or for
which no one has Tokens left to buy aren’t established
in the game, yet. After Heroes are created and play
starts player’s can spend Logos to establish any facts
that couldn’t be established earlier (Or they can
establish all new facts.).

With some broad facts about the world established,
probably with specific Heroes in mind, it is time to get
to creating those Heroes.
