With the world created, at least to some degree, the 
players may want to take a moment before they create 
their Heroes to decide if the Heroes they're about 
to create already know each other.

During a new campaign the Heroes will fall into one 
of the below categories:

* Established Crew with deep history of shared 
experience, and probably trust.
* A loosely associated conglomerate of people.  
There is no particular trust or history, but they
all travel in the same circles and know each other 
by reputation, if not more. 
* Complete strangers who 
for some reason all find themselves in the same 
tavern.
* Complete strangers who may or may not travel in 
the same parts of the campaign world.

All the choices require the group to work together 
if they want to be considered a group.  They don't 
have to end up a group, who hang out in each other's 
scenes, they could be having their own adventures in 
a shared world, but that isn't what most groups want. 

The earlier choices front-loads that work during 
Hero creation, while the latter categories 
defers that work until the play begins.  All choices 
are fine, but it might be a good idea for the 
group to make that choice.
