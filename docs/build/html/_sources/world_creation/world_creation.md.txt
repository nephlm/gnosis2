# World Creation

## Pitch Session

When the group sits down for the first session of
a new campaign the world is a complete blank
slate, so the game begins with a pitch session.

### Tone?

Before getting specific ideas or pitches on the table it
might be beneficial to spend a moment to decide on
tone. Are people looking for a dark and gritty game or
a light four color heroes or even a cartoon sort of
game? Nothing is written in stone but get the feeling
of the people at the table.

### Tech Level?

What is the prevalent level of technology in the
world? Is everyone at the same tech level or are
different cultures or countries use vastly different
technologies? Does Creation have a stone-age,
medieval, steam age, modern, cyberpunk or stellar
empire general tech vibe? For extremely advanced
technologies it may be thought of more as magic than
tech. No hard and fast rules are needed at this point
just a get a feel for what level of tech people are
interested in.

### Magic Level?

Another meta question is what is the place and
prevalence of magic? Is the table looking for a game
where fireballs and rings of invisibility are common
occurrences or is magic rare, dangerous and hard? You
don’t have to answer the question of why any of these
things are true, just get a general feel for the world
you are about to create.

### Pitches

I start off any pitch session by asking what people
don’t want to play. Sometime someone is burned out
on fantasy or couldn’t stand the idea of another
cyberpunk game. It’s best to know that early and just
avoid those in the pitches to come.

Once you know what to avoid it is time for all the
participants to throw out some pitches. Don’t bother
to delve into them just jot them down. If it takes more
than a sentence or two you are going too dee Keep in
mind this is traditional pitch session, you only have an
elevator ride to get the idea out there.

Once you have four or five pitches on the table you
start alternately delving into the pitch to see what the
table thinks the pitch means and eliminating ideas that
aren’t grabbing the tables attention. Just keep
throwing out questions and letting people answer.
Write down the answers to these questions but for
reasons that will become clear in a moment none of the
answers are `true` yet.

Feel free to mix and match elements from various
pitches. How else do you get space westerns? After
unpacking a few ideas if one emerges that the table
likes go with that. If no consensus emerges that clicks
with everyone don’t be afraid the throw it all away
and proceed fresh.

Once you have a pitch you like and few facts backing
it up it is time to establish some facts. Unfortunately
we can’t do that until we learn about...
