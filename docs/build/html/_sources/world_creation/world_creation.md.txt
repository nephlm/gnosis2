All the players make the game world together, 
so each campaign must start with a pitch session
where players come together and decide what world they 
want to play in.

## Tone

Before generating specific ideas or pitches, 
spend a moment to decide on a 
tone. 

Are people looking for a something epic, 
light four color heroes or even a cartoon sort of
game? Nothing is written in stone but get the feeling
of the people at the table.

The system itself skews fairly heroic, lacking mechanisms 
for permanent disfigurement, sanity loss and other systems
common in darker games.  This can be adjusted, or just handwaved, 
but more work will be required to play a deadly dark game.



## Redlines

Any pitch session should start by asking what people
don’t want to play. Are people burned out on 
western fantasy or cyberpunk? 
It’s best to know that early.

The goal is to find a pitch that engages everyone
enough to build that world, so discarding anything
that won't make the cut early is helpful. 

## Pitches

Next, it's time for some actual pitches.  

* A pitch should be one or two sentences maximum. 
* They don't have to be complete idea or settings, a
component to add to another pitch also helps.
* Don’t bother
to get specific, just write them down and move on.

* Government B list superheroes.
* Fallen Angels search for noble souls in New York City.
* Competitive steampunk inventors.
* Rebellion against the space empire.
* Mobsters in a fantasy world.
* Post apocalyptic St. Louis after peace with the aliens.
* Megacorp infighting.
* Samurais and dinosaurs.
* Caretakers of a living ship.
* Mecha and aliens.

```



After there are four or five pitches on the table, 
start delving into the pitches.  Don't go deep, go wide.

Pick up a pitch and ask a few questions, fleshing it
out, then move on to the next one. During this process people may reject pitches,
add new pitches, or merge pitches.  This is great 
don't interrupt it.  


If a pitch isn't grabbing anyone, throw it away.
Mix and match elements from different 
pitches.
Ask more questions about pitches that seem to have
legs. Flesh it out making it more real.

No matter what the answers, they are just ideas, 
so don't be afraid to go wild.  Keep going until 
you have a pitch the whole table is excited about.

If you come to a dead end, and find nothing everyone 
loves, don't be afraid to throw it all out and 
generate some new pitches. 
Everyone at the table is going to invest precious
time into this world your group is creating, 
it should be something they all want to 
spend time with.


When you find something everyone loves, take a moment
to lock down a couple of settings.  These will make
sure everyone is on the same page, and allow 
narration to be credible to everyone.

## Tech Level

What is the level of technology in the
world? Is everyone at the same tech level,  or do
different cultures or countries use vastly different
technologies? 

The world may also have very different tech levels for different 
technologies.  For example, high biological tech, but limited
information tech.  For extremely advanced
technologies it may be thought of more as magic as
tech. 

## Magic Level

Another question to ask is what is the place and
prevalence of magic? Is the group looking for a game
where fireballs and rings of invisibility are common
occurrences, or is magic rare, dangerous and hard? 

Make sure everyone is on at least a similar page. 
If there is magic, what sorts of magic exist in the world? 
Is there one system or many?
Flexible or prescribed?
Players will get a chance to dictate answers, but for 
now it's good enough to have an idea.
