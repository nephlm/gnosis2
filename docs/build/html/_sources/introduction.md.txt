# Introduction

Welcome to Gnosis a narrative game of collaborative world 
creation and epic stories.  In Gnosis the GM, as well as all 
other players, work together to craft stories that the whole 
table enjoys.

## Creation

Gnosis is a game that leans toward an epic and heroic tone, but it works
with any setting.  That setting is called Creation and in the central framing
of the game, Creation is created by demiurges to impress the Story.

This setting is defined by all the players, not just the GM, and evolves and 
grows over time.  

## Demiurge

Demiurges are imperfect creator spirits that create the material world.  In 
Gnosis the players play both a Demiurge and a Hero.  

For whatever reason Demiurges are driven to create interesting situations 
and urge Heroes into them.  If that makes them sound like role playing 
game players, you're not wrong. 

Demiurges don't get spotlight time, but they are how players create the 
setting and quests to lure the Heroes into action. **Logos** is the 
currency the Demiurges spend to create [Facts](facts.md) and 
[Quests](quests.md).

## Hero

The Hero may be more or less heroic, depending on the setting that 
is chosen and the game the players want to play, but Heroes are the 
protagonists of the story being told.  These are the characters 
controlled by the players, and can be as varied as the settings
they are played in.

Each Hero is defined by a [High Concept](hero_creation/character_creation.md)
and a [Trouble](hero_creation/character_creation.md).

### Attributes

Each Hero has three [attributes](hero_creation/attributes.md): 

* **Power**: A measure of raw power, physical, magical, political, persuasive or anything else.
* **Precision**: A measure of finesse and accuracy.  Precision is about using small amounts of power very effectively.
* **Possibility**: A measure of a character's ability spot, create and exploit opportunities.

Heroes get a d12, d10 and d8 to assign, one to each attribute.

#### Rolls

The basic dice roll to accomplish anything is to roll the Heroes 
Power, Precisions and Possibility and add up the total. 
That number is compared to an opposed roll, or sometimes as set number.

As the Hero gets better by acquiring [Boons](hero_creation/boons/boons.md), each attribute will get up to
three tiers of {{advantage}}. 

### Boons

[Boons](hero_creation/boons/boons.md)
are a broad set of things that are part of a Hero.
They are the building blocks that build a Hero.
Broadly these are Talents, Gear, Network and 
Locations.

Boons are narrative and unique.  There is an infinite set of Boons, 
the only limit is imagination and the credibility of the table.

### Secrets

Secrets are how a Hero bends the rules.  Not of Creation, a Hero doesn't 
need a Secret to cast a spell as long as Creation has magic, and they are 
a some sort of spell caster, but of fortune.

Secrets allow Heroes to do things to shift fortune in their favor.
Each Hero has their own Secrets.

### Keys

A Heroes Keys are mix of their motivations, obsessions and natures.  
They may be related to a character's {{Trouble}}, or maybe separate, 
but like a character's Trouble they motivate a Hero to action.  

When a Hero's Keys come up in play the Hero gains Favor.

### Favor

Favor is the currency that players spend to make their Heroes do more 
than they usually can.  Favor is flexible and can be used for a lot 
of effects, everything from powering [Secrets](hero_creation/secrets.md)
to re-rolling dice and other effects.
