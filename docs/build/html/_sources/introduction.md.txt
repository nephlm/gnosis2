# Introduction

Welcome to Gnosis a narrative game of collaborative world 
creation and epic stories.  In Gnosis the GM, as well as all 
other players, work together to craft stories that the whole 
table enjoys.

## Creation

Gnosis is a game that leans toward an epic and heroic tone, but it works
with any setting.  That setting is called Creation and in the central framing
of the game, Creation is created by demiurges to impress the Story.

This setting is defined by all the players, not just the GM, and evolves and 
grows over time.  

## Demiurge

Demiurges are imperfect creator spirits that create the material world.  In 
Gnosis the players play both a Demiurge and a Hero.  

For whatever reason Demiurges are driven to create interesting situations 
and urge Heroes into them.  If that makes them sound like role playing 
game players, you're not wrong. 

Demiurges don't get spotlight time, but they are how players create the 
setting and quests to lure the Heroes into action. **Logos** is the 
currency the Demiurges spend to create [Facts](facts.md) and 
[Quests](quests.md).

## Hero

The Hero may be more or less heroic, depending on the setting that 
is chosen and the game the players want to play, but Heroes are the 
protagonists of the story being told.  These are the characters 
controlled by the players, and can be as varied as the settings
they are played in.

Each Hero is defined by a [High Concept](hero_creation/character_creation.md)
and a [Trouble](hero_creation/character_creation.md).

### Attributes

Each Hero has three [attributes](hero_creation/attributes.md): 

* **Power**: A measure of raw power, physical, magical, political, persuasive or anything else.
* **Precision**: A measure of finesse and accuracy.  Precision is about using small amounts of power very effectively.
* **Possibility**: A measure of a character's ability spot, create and exploit opportunities.

Heroes get a d12, d10 and d8 to assign, one to each attribute.

#### Rolls

The basic dice roll to accomplish anything is to roll the Heroes 
Power, Precisions and Possibility and add up the total. 
That number is compared to an opposed roll, or sometimes as set number.

As the Hero gets better by acquiring [Boons](hero_creation/boons/boons.md), each attribute will get up to
three tiers of {{advantage}}. 

### Boons

[Boons](hero_creation/boons/boons.md)
are a broad set of things that are part of a Hero.
They are the building blocks that build a Hero.
Broadly these are Talents, Gear, Network and 
Locations.

Boons are narrative and unique.  There is an infinite set of Boons, 
the only limit is imagination and the credibility of the table.

### Secrets

Secrets are how a Hero bends the rules.  Not of Creation, a Hero doesn't 
need a Secret to cast a spell as long as Creation has magic, and they are 
a some sort of spell caster, but of fortune.

Secrets allow Heroes to do things to shift fortune in their favor.
Each Hero has their own Secrets.

### Keys

A Heroes Keys are mix of their motivations, obsessions and natures.  
They may be related to a character's {{Trouble}}, or maybe separate, 
but like a character's Trouble they motivate a Hero to action.  

When a Hero's Keys come up in play the Hero gains Favor.

### Favor

Favor is the currency that players spend to make their Heroes do more 
than they usually can.  Favor is flexible and can be used for a lot 
of effects, everything from powering [Secrets](hero_creation/secrets.md)
to re-rolling dice and other effects.

Gnosis is a collaborative roleplaying game where
the responsibility for world creation is the
ongoing responsibility of all the players at the table. 
This is different from more traditional roleplaying games, 
where one player,
the GM, is responsible for creating the world.

One of the goals of Gnosis is to turn that on its head
to solve traditional issues of the load that is borne by 
the GM as well as player engagement with the story being 
told.

Since world creation, including the
metaphysics of the world, is done at the table by all
participants, all players should be able to drive the
story in a direction that they find engaging. And since
all participants are doing this, the responsibility of
game prep doesn’t fall to one person.

There still is a GM, and he is responsible for many
aspects of running the game, but he isn’t
responsible for world creation or creating detailed stat
blocks.

Throughout the game, each player will receive 
[Logos](world_creation/demiurge.md), which
can be spent to establish [facts](world_creation/facts.md) 
in the world. 

If a
player wants his character to be part of a multi-nation
smuggling ring, he can establish the existence of such a
ring by spending Logos. 

Every fact that is established in the world comes with
a **price**.  The price is an additional fact that works 
against whoever
benefited from the original fact. This is the price of
creation by imperfect demiurges. Even the GM
must spend Logos to create facts, and even their facts
have prices.

Players may also use Logos to create [Quests](world_creation/quests.md).
Quests relay to the  GM and
other players which direction they’d like the story to
go, and is also how their [Hero](hero_creation/character_creation.md)
advance, gaining skill, power and luck. 

When a Hero accomplishes a quest,  they (or another
player) created, they get xp.  To drive
the game in a diplomatic direction,  all a player has to do is
spend their Logos to create quests that can be
accomplished through diplomacy.

Challenges, including villains and monsters, are abstracted
into very simple representation.  A GM (or player) may spend
time figuring how to narrate what a villain wants, or 
what they would do, but little time will be taken creating 
stat blocks for them.

With that in mind, let's build a [world](world_creation/world_creation.md).
