# Introduction

Gnosis is a collaborative roleplaying game where
the responsibility for world creation is the
ongoing responsibility of all the players at the table. 
This is different from more traditional roleplaying games, 
where one player,
the GM, is responsible for creating the world.

One of the goals of Gnosis is to turn that on its head
to solve traditional issues of the load that is borne by 
the GM as well as player engagement with the story being 
told.

Since world creation, including the
metaphysics of the world, is done at the table by all
participants, all players should be able to drive the
story in a direction that they find engaging. And since
all participants are doing this, the responsibility of
game prep doesn’t fall to one person.

There still is a GM, and he is responsible for many
aspects of running the game, but he isn’t
responsible for world creation or creating detailed stat
blocks.

Throughout the game, each player will receive 
[Logos](world_creation/demiurge.md), which
can be spent to establish [facts](world_creation/facts.md) 
in the world. 

If a
player wants his character to be part of a multi-nation
smuggling ring, he can establish the existence of such a
ring by spending Logos. 

Every fact that is established in the world comes with
a **price**.  The price is an additional fact that works 
against whoever
benefited from the original fact. This is the price of
creation by imperfect demiurges. Even the GM
must spend Logos to create facts, and even their facts
have prices.

Players may also use Logos to create [Quests](world_creation/quests.md).
Quests relay to the  GM and
other players which direction they’d like the story to
go, and is also how their [Hero](hero_creation/character_creation.md)
advance, gaining skill, power and luck. 

When a Hero accomplishes a quest,  they (or another
player) created, they get xp.  To drive
the game in a diplomatic direction,  all a player has to do is
spend their Logos to create quests that can be
accomplished through diplomacy.

Challenges, including villains and monsters, are abstracted
into very simple representation.  A GM (or player) may spend
time figuring how to narrate what a villain wants, or 
what they would do, but little time will be taken creating 
stat blocks for them.

With that in mind, let's build a [world](world_creation/world_creation.md).
