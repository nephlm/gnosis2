# Introduction

Welcome to Gnosis, a narrative game of collaborative world 
creation and epic stories.  In Gnosis, the GM, as well as all 
other players, work together to craft stories for the enjoyment
of the whole table.

## Telling Stories Together

The purpose of playing the game, is to collaboratively tell a 
story that engages everyone. This means everyone at the table, 
not just the GM, is responsible for making that story emerge.

As one of those players, consider two things when choosing 
action, narration and outcomes: 

* What would the character do?  Not necessarily what is optimal, but 
what would that particular character with all their flaws and baggage
do?
* What would make a better story?  What would make the story being 
told cooler, more exciting, funnier.  Why aren't you choosing to 
make the story better?

## Session Zero

Session Zero is the idea that the group will meet before
initializing the shared imagery space
and discuss the parameters of the game to come.  This is 
traditionally where the social contract between all the players is 
discussed and ensures everyone has similar expectations.  

This is the 
point to discuss limits, things that players don't want to see in the game,
and veils, things that if they appear will be quickly glossed over 
rather than graphically dwelt on.  For many groups these topics end up 
being such things as racial violence, violence against children, sexual 
assault, etc.

In Gnosis, it is also when the group will work cooperatively to build the 
world and the Heroes.  World creation and Hero creation should be a group 
activity done in the context of session zero with understanding of 
the groups expectations.

## Creation

Gnosis is a game that leans toward an epic and heroic tone, but it works
with any setting.  That setting is called Creation and in the central framing
of the game, [Creation](world_creation/world_creation.md) is created by {{Demiurges}} to impress the Story, a 
all encompassing perfect spiritual entity that created the Demiurges.

This setting is defined by all the players, not just the GM, and evolves and 
grows over time.  

## Demiurge

In 
Gnosis the players play both a Demiurge and a Hero.  

For whatever reason Demiurges are driven to create interesting situations 
and urge Heroes into them.  If that makes them sound like role playing 
game players, you're not wrong. 

Demiurges don't get spotlight time or personalties, 
they are the impersonal conceit used to create the 
setting and quests to lure the Heroes into action. {{Logos}} is the 
currency the Demiurges spend to create [Facts](world_creation/facts.md) and 
[Quests](hero_creation/quests.md).

If the group needs to explain some bit of table talk and coordination
that the Heroes couldn't do, Demiurges allow that to happen.
Demiurges are as inexplicable to {{Creation}} and the Heroes
as the players are.

### Logos

[Logos](tools/currency.md#logos) 
is the Currency spent by the Demiurge to alter Creation
and create Quests for their Heroes.  Demiurges recover a Logos
at the beginning of each session, completions of Quests
and after Facts appear in the Story a few times.

## Hero

The Hero may be more or less heroic, depending on the setting that 
is chosen and the game the players want to play, but Heroes are the 
protagonists of the story being told.  These are the characters 
controlled by the players, and can be as varied as the settings
they are played in.

Each Hero is defined by a 
[High Concept](hero_creation/character_creation.md#high-concept)
and a [Trouble](hero_creation/character_creation.md#trouble).

### Attributes

Each Hero has three [attributes](hero_creation/attributes.md): 

* **Power**: A measure of raw power, physical, magical, political, persuasive or anything else.
* **Precision**: A measure of finesse and accuracy.  Precision is about using small amounts of power very effectively.
* **Possibility**: A measure of a character's ability spot, create and exploit opportunities.

Heroes get a d12, d10 and d8 to assign, one to each attribute.

#### Attribute Roll

The basic dice roll to accomplish anything is to roll the Heroes 
Power, Precisions and Possibility and add up the total. 
That number is compared to an opposed roll, or sometimes as set number.
This is called an Attribute Roll.

As the Hero gets better, by acquiring [Boons](hero_creation/boons/boons.md), each attribute will get up to
three tiers of {{advantage}}. 

### Boons

[Boons](hero_creation/boons/boons.md)
are a broad set of things that are part of a Hero.
They are the building blocks that build a Hero.
[Talents](hero_creation/boons/talents.md), 
[Gear](hero_creation/boons/gear.md), 
[Kith](hero_creation/boons/kith.md) and
[Locations](hero_creation/boons/location.md)
are the main categories of Boons.

Boons are narrative and unique.  There is an infinite set of Boons, 
the only limit is a player's imagination and 
the credibility of the table.

### Edges

[Edges](hero_creation/edges.md) are how a Hero bends the rules. 
Not of {{Creation}}, a Hero doesn't 
need an Edge to cast a spell as long as {{Creation}} has magic, and they are 
some sort of magic user.  Edges bend the rules of fortune and 
bend the game mechanics in the Hero's favor in certain circumstances.

Edges allow Heroes to do things to shift fortune in their favor.
Each Hero has their own Edges.  A Hero must spend {{Favor}}
to activate their Edges.

### Paths

A Hero's 
[Paths](hero_creation/paths.md)
 are mix of their motivations, obsessions and natures. 
They may be related to a character's {{Trouble}}, or may be separate, 
but like a character's Trouble they motivate a Hero to action.  

When a Hero's Paths come up in play the Hero gains {{Favor}}.

### Favor

[Favor](tools/currency.md#favor) 
is the currency that players spend to make their Heroes do more 
than they usually can.  Favor is flexible and can be used for a lot 
of effects, everything from powering [Edges](hero_creation/edges.md)
to re-rolling dice and other effects.

A Hero's starts each session with eight Favor, and there are various 
things that allow a Hero to recover one or more Favor during the 
Session.
