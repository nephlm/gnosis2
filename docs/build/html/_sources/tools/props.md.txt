# Props

Props are anything that a Hero can use in a 
{{Strategy}}, but they did not pay xp for.
It is the
GM's sworn duty to destroy or remove these Props
from the Hero's control.

Usually Props are equipment looted, scavenged
or bought with money, but as we'll see they
may actually be a staggering array of things.

A Prop may be used once each challenge without
cost, but subsequent uses require 
[Favor](currency.md#favor).

A Prop has a tier level just as if it was 
[Boon](../hero_creation/boons/boons.md)
and may be used in a Strategy as if it was one 
of the Hero's boons.

Props can be used to soak damage like a Boon, 
but they are destroyed by the sacrifice.  
If they are sacrificed the same session they are 
acquired, the Hero gains a Favor. 

The GM may put special limitation on particular Props:

* Slow Burn — Every use degrades them one
level, such as an ablative shield.
* One Shot — One use, and they are gone, like a grenade.
* Session — Only usable once per session, 
such as any item with a long recharge cycle.

## It's all Props

While acquired gear is the most common form of a Prop, it 
is far from the only one.  
The most obvious other form is a 
[Maneuver](../play/resolution.md#maneuvers), these actions 
create some form of advantage that is usable once 
in a {{Strategy}} for 
free, and then cost Favor.  They are Props.

Environmental factors and situations fall into the same 
category.  Unstable terrain or high winds are environmental
factors that can be exploited by a Hero that behave exactly
like Props.  

But so do castle walls, or a mob of villagers 
with torches and pitchforks.  In a {{Strategy}} both 
can be used as Boon for an Attribute Roll.  First one 
is free, then they start cost Favor to use in a 
Strategy.

It's all Props, really.

If a player is hoping to bet more dice to roll, it will likely fit into one of those three categories, or something sufficiently similar that the GM can 
massage it into one of those categories.
