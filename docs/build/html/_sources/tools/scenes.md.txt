# Scenes


> Don't show what doesn't matter.

The formula for a thriller is that fast stuff happens
slow and slow stuff happens fast.  Most campaigns are
probably a lot closer to a thriller than the 
great american novel.

With that in mind, scenes have three phases: 
Faming, narration and recovery.

## Framing

Faming is simply deciding what to show.  Everyone has 
limited time together around the table and wants to
get the most out of it.  Hero's have Quests, Paths, 
Kith, Locations and even some Gear and Talents that 
are telling story of what sort of scenes the 
player wants to see.  

If a scene isn't anticipated to do 
character development, 
plot progression or world building (preferably
at least two of the three), then that scene 
probably shouldn't be played out at the table. 

Allow the player's the agency to drive the action
forward.

Become familiar with saying that after several 
days the Heroes arrive at the distant town.  
Gnosis isn't a game usually served by random 
fights that don't progress the plot. 

Once it's decided that a scene is worth playing
out, decide where and when it takes place and 
who's there. 

## Narration

Narration is simply the meat of the scene. 
What Hero's and NPCs do and say, what secrets
are revealed and who is betrayed.  

Most scenes that were believed to be worth 
playing out will eventually have some sort of 
{{Challenge}}, whether that be martial, 
mental, social or whatever. 
That's when the challenge and resolution mechanics
come into the play and players end up rolling dice. 

Most of the bits around that mechanical resolution
are someone narrating.  Maybe players narrating what 
their Heroes do, maybe the GM narrating what is there
or maybe players narrating the resolution of those 
challenges.  


## Recovery

Usually before moving on to the next scene there is a 
recovery.  If Stress or Blood was taken there is a 
chance to recover from that, and take care of any 
other post-scene issues.  

Once that's done it's time to frame the next 
scene and move ever onward.
