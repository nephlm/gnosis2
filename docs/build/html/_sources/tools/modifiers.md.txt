# Modifiers

Sometimes (often) players want to build more advantage than just 
their Hero's [Boons](../hero_creation/boons/boons.md) 
would provide.  In Gnosis, this generally 
means gaining access to a Boon they normally don't have access to.
There are a few variations on this, but they all adhere to 
fairly similar rules.


* [Working Together](#working-together) - 
Two or more Heroes work together and pool Boons.
* [Maneuver](#maneuver) - 
Take an action to prepare or provide advantage.
* [Assess](#assess) - 
Discover or notice something about the situation and use it for advantage.
* [Prop](#props) - 
Gear that has been found, bought or stolen, 
that a Hero has not bought as a Boon.
* [Circumstances](#circumstances) - 
Exploiting environmental factors beyond the Hero's control.

Conceptually Working Together, Maneuvers and Assess 
are grouped together as they both
cost actions and only affect a single roll, while props and circumstances are
free to exploit once during a scene.  To exploit any of them other than 
Working Together additional times during a scene requires spending a Favor
to activate it.

## Working Together

Whenever two Heroes are working with the same 
[Intent](../play/challenge.md#intent), they can pool resources.  Just as a Hero
can add a [](../hero_creation/boons/kith.md#companion) to their [](../play/challenge.md#strategy), they may also add another Hero.  

In practice this means that any [Boons](../hero_creation/boons/boons.md)
that any of the Heroes working together have access to may be used to build a 
{{Strategy}}.  It uses the [action](../play/play.md#exploration--action) of all
Heroes contributing the Strategy. 

Only one player rolls dice using the attribute dice of their Hero, which player 
rolls is up to the players to decide among themselves.

Any [Consequences](../play/consequences.md) are evenly distributed among the 
Heroes that were working together.  Any question about how to divvy up 
Consequences is determined by the [Narration](../play/narration.md) that 
resulted from the challenge.

> Two junior Heroes work together to try and take down a hunter-killer android.
The two decide that Alvin is going to get the android's attention while Beth
shoots it in the head from cover.  Alvin  contributes *Bright Clothing* to 
Possibility and *Subdermal Armor* to Power, while Beth adds *Headshot* to Precision.
>
> The players decide that Alvin will roll the dice.  Narratively, if they fail 
and there is one Consequence Alvin will take it 
since he's the bait, but if they 
critically fail and there are two consequences, the android returned 
fire on Beth as well and both end up taking a consequence, in this case a 
point of Blood.

## Maneuver

The character spends their action and does something make a more 
advantageous environment.  

The Hero makes an unopposed Attribute Roll, the result of the roll
determines the Tier of the [Circumstance](#circumstances) that can
be created.  The roll is not made against the Pain Pool, so is usually 
easier, but it isn't guaranteed to be a *safe* roll, it could still
fail and result in [Stress or Blood](../play/consequences.md#stress--blood).

|Result|Tier|
|:-:|:-:|
|16+|1|
|20+|2|
|24+|3|

The [](../play/challenge.md#strategy) can be anything that could change
the environment in some way.  

> A gunfight broke out down the block, a Hero decides to jump into a car 
and pull it across the road so it can be used as cover.  They use their 
*Heavy Wrench*, *Ace Driver* and *Mechanical Aptitude* for Power, Precision and 
Possibility respectively to smash a window, get the car started and pull
it across the road.
>
> They roll a 21, so the resulting *Road Block* circumstance is Tier 2.


As per normal Circumstance rules it can be used once, either by the Hero
that created it, or by another Hero.  The Hero can choose to spend a 
[](currency.md#favor) instead of an action to create the Circumstance,
if they do that, they may use the Circumstance any number of times, 
just as if they had spent the Favor on a pre-existing Circumstance.



## Assess

Mechanically Assess is identical to [](#maneuver), the only difference is 
rather than creating and exploitable environmental circumstance, they know 
something about their adversary that they can exploit.

This may be something about their equipment, personality, tactics, etc. 
Whichever it is, the Hero can use it themselves or, if they can communicate,
let one of their allies use the information.


|Result|Tier|
|:-:|:-:|
|16+|1|
|20+|2|
|24+|3|

Like any other Circumstance, it can be used once for free, to use it again,
requires spending a Favor. 
Same rules about spending Favor to re-use the created Circumstance from 
Maneuvers apply. 

> A technician Hero, who is hiding in cover 
as far from the attacking power armor as he 
can be, makes an Assess action to know something about the powerarmor worn by 
the attackers.  He rolls *Doctor of Mechanical Engineering*, *Powerarmor Repair*
and *Encyclopedic Memory* and rolls a 22, so if he can communicate with his 
allies he can tell them about the Tier 2 *Weak Left Knee Actuator* that they 
could use.

## Props

Props are gear/equipment that a Hero acquired without paying {{xp}}.
It is the
GM's sworn duty to destroy or remove these Props
from the Hero's control.

Usually Props are equipment looted, scavenged
or bought with money that is not [](../hero_creation/boons/gear.md#kit-gear).
Props have a tier and can be used as Boon once during a scene for 
free. Subsequent uses require activating the Prop with 
[Favor](currency.md#favor).  One Favor will activate the Prop for the 
whole scene.

If the player can narrative justify it, a Hero can sacrifice a Prop
to soak a single point of 
[Stress or Blood](../play/consequences.md#stress--blood), and 
the prop is destroyed by being sacrificed.  Heroes that sacrifice a 
Prop recover a point of [](currency.md#favor).

A Prop can be converted to a [](../hero_creation/boons/gear.md) Boon
by spending xp on it, or into Kit Gear by removing its tier. 

A Prop can have any of the normal 
[cirucmstance modifiers](#circumstance-modifiers).


## Circumstances

```{image} /_static/fire_hall.jpg
:width: 33%
:align: right
```

Circumstances are anything that gives a Hero an advantage, 
such as darkness, performance enhancing drugs,
castle walls, etc.

Generally Circumstances can be exploited once without cost, to 
continue to use them requires spending a Favor.  A single Favor
will activate Circumstances for the Scene without further cost.

Circumstances have tiers like [](../hero_creation/boons/boons.md), 
and are added to [Strategies](../play/challenge.md#strategy) like 
any other Boon.  

### Circumstance Modifiers

The GM may put special modifiers on some Circumstances 
if they behaved differently than the general rules described above:

* Slow Burn — Every use degrades them one
tier, such as *Weak Cover*.
* One Shot — One use, and they are gone, like a *Car Dangling From A Crane*.
These Circumstances can't be activated with Favor.
* Session — Only usable once per session, 
such as *Industrial Capacitor*.

There are other possibilities, these are just some examples of possible 
modifiers.




### It's all Circumstances

[](#working-together), [](#maneuver), [](#assess) and [](#props)
are all just special cases of [](#circumstances).  They all 
may have special conditions on what it takes to use one and 
how long they are usable for, but fundamentally they all have:

* A creation method or cost
* Conditions necessary to use them

They all have a tier
and may be used as if they were Boons.
They are all are usable once if the conditions are met, and if it 
makes narrative sense, a Hero can spend a Favor and use them unlimited 
number of times until the end of the scene. 

It's all Circumstances, really.

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1

* - Type
  - Creation Method/Cost
  - Condition
  - Examples
* - Working Together
  - 2+ Heroes with the same Intent must spend their actions.
  - Ephemeral: Just while the Heroes are working together.
  - Flanking, Multiple engineers working together.
* - Maneuver
  - Take an action and make a Maneuver roll.
  - Scene: As long as whatever was done remains relevant.
  - Aiming, Good shooting position, Close to Castle.
* - Assess
  - Take an action and make an Assess roll.
  - Scene: Until the known thing no longer applies.
  - Dragon's weak belly scale, a guard's fondness for drink or a senator's fear of snakes.
* - Prop
  - Found, looted or bought gear that the Hero didn't pay xp for.
  - Until sacrificed, broken or lost.
  - Sword looted from a dead enemy or a radio jammer bought at the spy store.
* - Circumstance
  - Placed by the GM or Player spending Favor.
  - Scene: As long as relevant to the action.
  - Shadows to hide in, castle walls, high ground or patches of fire.
```

If a player is hoping to get more dice to roll, it will likely fit into one of those categories, or something sufficiently similar that the GM can 
massage it into similar rules.


## Disadvantage

In the situation where a circumstance occurs which doesn't seem endemic to 
the [Pain Pool](../play/challenge.md#difficulty) as a whole, nor that can 
be handled by [effect](../play/challenge.md#effect) the GM may inflict a level
of disadvantage on a Hero.

This functions exactly as if the Hero had received an additional 
[Wound](../play/consequences.md#wounds-and-trauma), 
countering levels of advantage on a one-for-one basis. 
The only practical difference is the level of disadvantage is 
cleared when the circumstance no longer applies, rather than the 
Hero having to heal it.

Circumstantial disadvantage is not a Wound, so 
[Edges](../hero_creation/edges.md) that affect Wounds would not 
impact these levels of disadvantage.
