# Credibility

With everyone able to alter the game world, even with a cost and price
there is often a temptation to go well beyond the campaign's 
High Concept. This is actually fine as long as the table agrees to that
expansion, but if not Credibility comes into the play.

When the campaign is twelve sessions into classic sword and sorcery
setting and someone spends a Logos and calls B-52 bombers in existence, 
what do you do?

* The group are all in on the idea:  Go with it.
* One or more people are shaking their heads and saying no:  It doesn't 
happen.

If the whole group aren't of one mind, see if the issue can be talked out, but
if not honor the credibility check.  This effectively gives a veto to everyone
in the group.  In groups where people are acting in good faith and working
together to build stories that everyone will enjoy, this is the right choice.

Credibility isn't just for over the top facts, it applies to narration as well
as facts.  It applies to Tone, tech level and magic.  Any limits and veils are
also subject to a credibility objection.

Credibility gives each player a lot of power to stymie other players, so 
it should be used very sparingly, and always only after trying to work together 
to find something that works.
