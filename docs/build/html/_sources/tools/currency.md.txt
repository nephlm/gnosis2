# Currencies

The two mechanical currencies, {{Logos}} and {{Favor}} 
are used to limit how often a player or Hero can do certain
things.  They are a resource that forces players to choose 
*when* they do cool things.

## Logos

Logos is used, in general, to do things the Hero 
is oblivious to.  [Facts](../world_creation/facts.md)
were always true as far as the Hero is concerned, 
and while they may have goals
that line up with [Quests](../hero_creation/quests.md),
they know nothing about the specific criteria for 
success or the rewards.  

If you need a currency for 
metagaming, world creation and similar concerns, that's Logos.

Each Demiurge has a **maximum of six Logos**, and any additional
Logos they gain are lost.  If the Demiurge gets a new Logos
when they are at their max, 
they can't "quickly" spend one to make space, it is lost. 

Generally, when a Demiurge spends a Logos they should get it
back, though it might be invested for an arbitrary length of
time.  

Logos Uses:

* Create Facts.
* Create Quests.

Logos Recovery:

* A Demiurge gains 
one Logos at the beginning of each session. 
* At the beginning of each session, the player with the 
least Logos, gains a Logos. 
* The third time a [Fact](../world_creation/facts.md) 
has come up in the game, the player that 
created that fact, gains a Logos.
* When a Hero completes one of their [Quests](../hero_creation/quests.md) 
they will almost always regain 
the Logos they invested in the Quest, though this is technically a reward of
the Quest, so it is subject to the GM setting the reward.

## Favor

Favor is used by the Hero when they are doing something special.
There are a few set uses for Favor and times when Favor is 
required, it is also the general way for a Hero to indicate that 
this matters, and they are willing to sacrifice something for it. 

In addition to whatever a Hero's [Edges](../hero_creation/edges.md) 
allow them to do with Favor, 
all Heroes can use favor to re-roll an Attribute Roll, and they 
may make a [maneuver or assess](modifiers.md#maneuver) 
roll without taking an action to do so.


Heroes may have a **maximum of 10 Favor** at any given time. Like 
Logos, Favor can't be "quickly" spent just as the Hero would go 
over their maximum. 

Favor Uses:

* Power [Edges](../hero_creation/edges.md).
* Do a [Maneuver](../tools/modifiers.md#maneuver) without taking a turn.
* [Assess](../tools/modifiers.md#assess) without taking a turn.
* Re-roll an Attribute Roll and accept the new value.
* Use a [Modifier](modifiers.md) more than once during a scene.
* Add environmental detail that seems unlikely.  A player can always suggest an 
environmental detail, and if the GM and group think the detail seems likely, than it is part of hte scene.  However, if the detail doesn't seem likely, but still seems possible, the GM may say that inserting that detail into the environment will cost a Favor.

Favor Recovery:


* Each Hero starts each session with at least 8 Favor.
* The first three times a [Fact](../world_creation/facts.md) 
comes up on play, the Hero gains a Favor.
* The first three times a Hero walks each of their 
[Paths](../hero_creation/paths.md) during
a session, the Hero gains a Favor.
* If a Hero chooses to step off a 
[Paths](../hero_creation/paths.md) they receive three Favor.
* If at the end of a scene a Hero has 0 Favor, they gain one Favor.
* If a Hero suffers [Consequences](../play/consequences.md#stress--blood) 
because of a Critical Failure, they gain a Favor.
* If a Hero must make a Recovery Roll,
due to [](../play/consequences.md#wounds-and-trauma) 
they took during the scene that just ended,
they gain a Favor.
* If a Hero sacrifices a [Prop](modifiers.md#props), they gain a Favor.
* GM whim.  The GM may give out Favor whenever they choose. 
This is not the main or usual way that a Hero recovers Favor, but 
it is something that can happen.
