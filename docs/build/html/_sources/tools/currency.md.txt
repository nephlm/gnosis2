# Currencies

The two mechanical currencies, {{Logos}} and {{Favor}} 
have already been mentioned. 

## Logos

Logos is used, in general, to do things the Hero 
is oblivious to.  [Facts](../world_creation/facts.md)
were always true, and while they may have goals
that line up with [Quests](../hero_creation/quests.md),
they know nothing about the specific criteria for 
success or the rewards.  

If you need a currency for something that lies somewhere
between metagaming and world creation, that's Logos.

Each Demiurge has a maximum of six Logos and any additional
Logos they gain are lost.  If the Demiurge gets a new Logos
when they are at their max, 
they can't "quickly" spend one to make space, it is lost. 

Generally when a Demiurge spends a Logos they should get it
back, though it might be invested for an arbitrary length of
time.  

Logos Uses:

* Create Facts.
* Create Quests.

Logos Recovery:

* A Demiurge that starts a session with 0 Logos, gains 
one Logos. 
* At the beginning of each session, the player with the 
least Logos, gains a Logos. 
* After a Fact has come up in the game three times.
* When a Hero completes one of their Quests (usually).

## Favor

Favor is used by the Hero when they are doing something special.
There are a few set uses for Favor and times when Favor is 
required, it is also the general way for a Hero to indicate that 
this matters, and they are willing to sacrifice something for it. 

In addition to whatever a Hero's Edges allow them to do with Favor, 
all Heroes can use favor to re-roll and Attribute Roll, and they 
may make a maneuver roll without taking an action to do so.

In addition to the mechanical things, Favor can also be used as 
a very light version of Logos to make some minor thing in the 
setting true.  

> Player: I look around the room for something that can be used 
as a weapon.
>
> GM: I don't know, it's been pretty well cleaned out.
>
> Player: (Pushes a Favor across the table.)
>
> GM: When you look again you see a broom leaning in the corner, and it 
looks like it has a pretty thick handle.
High quality.  They don't make 'em like this anymore.

Heroes may have a maximum of 10 Favor at any given time. Like 
Logos, Favor can't be "quickly" spent just as the Hero would go 
over their maximum. 

Favor Uses:

* Power [Edges](../hero_creation/edges.md).
* Add environmental details.
* Do a [Maneuver](../play/resolution.md#maneuvers) without taking a turn.
* Re-roll an Attribute Roll and accept the new value.
* Use a [Prop](props.md) more than once during a challenge.

Favor Recovery:

* Start each session with at least 8 Favor.
* First three times a [Fact](../world_creation/facts.md) comes up on play.
* Gain a Favor for each [Downtime](downtime.md) action taken during a session.
* If at the end of a scene and the Hero has 0 Favor.
* If the Hero suffers consequences of a Critical Failure, they gain a Favor.
* If the Hero must make a Recovery Roll 
due to consequences they took during the scene that just ended.
* If a Hero sacrifices a [Prop](props.md).
* GM whim.  The GM may give out Favor whenever they choose.
