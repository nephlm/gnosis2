# Progress Clocks

Progress clocks are a tool for tracking and visually 
representing effort expended toward a task, or 
a countdown until something bad happens.  

At its heart a progress clock is a circle divided into 
wedges that serves as a visual representation of how 
close something is to being done and how many steps 
are left.  

In the basic progress clock, wedges are often filled
by successes or failures (or two wedges for criticals), 
but the criteria to fill a wedge could be anything.

An enchanter Hero could a have a progress clock tracking
the downtime they've spent to make their 
*Staff of Smashing Annoying People*, or they may be 
filled each time the alien hive mind consumes a human 
and gets one step closer to understanding humanity well enough 
to consume the 
whole human race. 

Major villains are differentiated from normal 
[challenges](../play/challenge.md)
by having a progress clock, it will take more than one
exchange to take them out. These are often called 
complex challenges.

### Clock Sizes

Progress clocks can have two or more sections only 
limited by the number that can be told apart.  
Things get dicey over twelve, but even then, 
there can be linked clocks.  When one completes, 
simply roll over to the next.

For standard progress clocks that fill one section
on a success, and two on a critical success (or failures)
consider if a progress clock less than three is desirable.
A progress clock of three can't be overcome in a single
action, while a two section clock could be.  

### Uses

Clocks generally fall into two categories:  Effort and countdown.
Effort clocks are generally positive and fill while the 
Heroes succeed at things, while countdown clocks fill
when the Heroes fail, their adversaries succeed or 
simply with the passage of time. 

If the Heroes are trying to do something that they can't 
immediately succeed at, they get an effort clock to track
how close to success they get. This might be something 
like developing a contact or escaping pursuit.

On the other side are countdown clocks which get filled
when progress is made toward a bad outcome. 
This can happen when Heroes fail stealth rolls and 
guards get more and more suspicious until they 
trigger a full alarm, or simply by taking downtime, 
allowing the villains to progress their plans 
unimpeded. 

Things get interesting when they are paired 
together.  The Hero is trying to hunt down a 
*Totally Bad Person* who's trying to escape the 
area.  The Bad person gets a countdown to 
escape clock, while the Heroes a capture effort clock.
Heroes failing fill the escape clock, while success 
fill the capture clock, whichever clock is filled 
first dictates the outcome.

### Examples


>The Heroes may have decided to dig a tunnel under the 
prison wall to rescue an ally.  This isn't the sort of 
thing that can normally be done instantly, and the 
longer they dig the more likely the guards will be 
alerted.  
>
>Two progress clocks are created, one for the tunnel
and one for alarm.  Each few hours the Heroes decide 
to spend tunnelling they will roll their 
Attribute Roll and each success will progress the 
tunnel clock, while each failure progresses the alarm 
clock.  If the alarm clock is filled before the 
tunnel clock, then the guards discover the 
tunnelling attempt before it's complete. 
If the tunnel completes, then the Heroes are able
to complete the tunnel before being discovered.

> The Heroes and a rival gang are competing for 
the hearts and minds in a new territory.  This is a 
slow process, taking days. 
>
>Each day the rival gang fills a section of 
their countdown timer, and if it fills the territory
falls to the rivals.  Each time the Heroes do 
something to try to sway the people they can 
make an Attribute Roll and fill their own 
progress clock, to win the minds of the territory.

> And of course the classic, there is a nuclear
bomb hidden in the city and the Heroes need to 
discover it before it goes off killing everyone 
the Heroes care about.  
>
> The GM fills the sections at an appropriate 
cadence as the Heroes investigate and interrogate
until they find the bomb or... They don't.
