# Challenges

Gnosis leans into narrative play, and has little interest in 
simulating each sword stroke or the position of each foot on the map.
Instead, being concerned with the soul of every story, conflict.

Some conflicts are merely **obstacles**, 
they don't actively oppose the Heroes, they are 
just in the way.  A storm when the Heroes are on a boat is an obstacle, it is 
unconcerned with the Heroes success or failure, it's just in the way

**Conflicts** on the other hand are when thinking entities are at actual 
cross purposes.  An art thief is in conflict with the Heroes protecting the 
museum.  The two sides will adjust, try different tacts, even withdraw and 
try a different approach.

Sometimes a thinking entity is just an obstacle, their goals don't 
conflict with what the Heroes want to accomplish, they're just in the
way.  A bouncer may not be in conflict with the Heroes, but an obstacle
the Heroes need to get around to get into the club.  The bouncer's 
goal is not to keep people out of the club, quite the opposite really, but 
they still may be an obstacle the Heroes must overcome in some way.


Whether an obstacle or a conflict, 
challenges are resolved by telling a story three times. 

* The first story is a story of the Heroes [intent](#intent).
* The second story is [how](#strategy) the Hero 
is going to attempt to accomplish their intent.
* Last story is what the Hero [accomplished](narration.md).

## Actions, Challenges and Scenes

The group and GM should endeavor to only spend valuable time
around the table on things that matter to someone. 
Fast-forward through shopping and travel scenes unless they 
matter to someone at the table.

This goes for challenges as well. Unless both success and 
failure are interesting, the interesting thing automatically 
happens.  

Some challenges are simple, requiring only one Hero gaining 
a normal success to overcome them.  Others have 
[progress clocks](../tools/progress.md) 
that track how much more the Heroes must do to overcome the 
challenge.  In these sorts of challenges when a Hero does 
something to overcome the challenge that is considered an 
action.  

The Hero who least recently took an action, gets precedence to 
take an action at any given moment when trying to determine who
gets to act.  Every 2-3 Hero actions the GM should consider if 
the Challenge should do anything.  

Since any attack includes
risk of losing the engagement, depending on the nature of the 
challenge they may not need to act that often since they will
automatically be delivering reprisals against the Heroes that 
are attacking them.

Once a Hero with precedence decides to take an action, it's 
time to declare an intent.

## Intent

The Hero's goal is almost never to hit someone with a weapon, 
they are hitting someone with a weapon for some other purpose,
it is a means to an end.
At the very least the Hero intends knock out or kill the person they 
are hitting, but in truth their intent may simply be to get past
a guard, hitting them might be one way of doing it, but it is 
hardly the only way.

Articulating the actual intent, is the first story.

## Strategy

With an intent firmly defined, it's time to tell the second story, 
the {{Strategy}} the Hero intends to use to achieve their intent.

This is where the player chooses which {{Boons}} the Hero will use, 
one per attribute.

A Hero with the intent of getting into the 
VIP section of a nightclub might build a Strategy such as:

> Power: Heir to the Markowski fortune  (tier 2)  
Precision: One of the Beautiful People  (tier 1)  
Possibility: Location: Nightclubs (tier 2)

or:

> Power: Repeating heavy blaster (tier 2)  
Precision: Headshot (tier 2)  
Possibility: Shock and awe (tier 1)

Both tell a story of how the Hero gets into the VIP lounge, but they 
tell very, very different stories.  If the Hero's goal is to schmooze a 
bigwig for a job opportunity, the second strategy may not be the best, 
but if the goal is to assassinate the bigwig, either might work.

The Strategy that the player 
builds for their Hero is the second story, the one that tells how the 
Hero will accomplish their intent.




## Difficulty

With a proposed Strategy in place the GM should set a difficulty, 
this is likely done by setting the size of the Pain Pool, though 
for some rolls the GM may choose to use a static difficulty. 

Whichever the case, the number of dice, or number, should be shared 
with the player.  Assuming the Hero is not incompetent in the 
area of conflict they'll have some sense of the difficulty of what 
their trying to do.  

If the GM and player have very different ideas of the difficulty that 
might be because they have different understandings of the situation, 
and it's best to clarify that situation and let the player choose a 
different course of action for their Hero.

The GM will set the size of the Pain Pool, which is 
the number of d10s they'll be rolling in opposition to 
the Hero's Attribute Roll.
Like players, they will only keep the best 3.  The fourth die is quite
impactful, but the 12th, doesn't significantly move the needle, just 
like Hero's Strategies.

|Name|Pain Pool Size| Static Difficulty | Mean Result |
| :-| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Unskilled     | 3  | 16 | 16.6 |
| Apprentice    | 4  | 20 | 19.7 |
| Journeyman    | 5  | 22 | 21.6 |
| Master        | 6  | 23 | 22.8 |
| Heroic        | 7  | 24 | 24.0 |
| Artist        | 8  | 25 | 24.8 |
| Inconceivable | 9  | 26 | 25.5 |
| Epic          | 10 | 26 | 26.0 |
| Legendary     | 11 | 26 | 26.4 |
| Mythic        | 12 | 27 | 26.8 |

There are diminishing returns on large pain pools. 
Before seven dice an additional die is more impactful than a +1 result, 
after that point and the reverse is true.

Heroes using just their {{Boons}} can have at most three levels of advantage
in each attribute pool, which is approximately equivalent to a 9 die 
Pain Pool (25.3 vs 25.5).  Even if they have all those Boons, by the nature
of tier 3 Boons, they should only be able to bring that to bear under 
limited circumstances. 

There comes a point where what you're trying to confront the Heroes with
is an impossible challenge which probably should be more correctly 
handled with [Effect](#effect) and [Risk](#risk), 
rather than adding more dice to the Pain Pool.

### Effect

Not all opposing forces operate on the same scale.  A normal person facing down 
the mile long imperial dreadnought while only armed with a six-shooter, 
is not going to be able to overcome that difference in scale and adding more
dice to the Pain Pool isn't going to be able to represent that difference.

If the scale is only marginally different or if the challenge is something 
that could be handled, but it's going to take prolonged effort, than 
simply adding a [Progress Clock](../tools/progress.md) may represent the 
effort it will take to overcome the challenge.

If so, draw the progress clock wherever your group keeps them and disclose it
when you disclose the difficulty.

For challenges that verge even closer to impossible, there will be additional
penalties to Hero's effectiveness.  By default, Heroes are assumed to have 
*Similar Power* to the challenges they attempt to overcome.  

:::{table} cons = consequence level

| Scale Difference | Critical Failure | Failure | Tie | Success | Critical Success |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Unheroic| 1 effect lvl at a cost | 1 effect lvl | 2 effect lvl | 3 effect lvls | 3 effect lvls |
|Punching Down|1 cons | 1 effect lvl at a cost | 1 effect lvl | 2 effect lvl | 3 effect lvls |
|Similar Power|2 cons | 1 cons | 1 effect lvl at a cost | 1 effect lvl | 2 effect lvls |
|Punching Up|3 cons | 2 cons | 1 cons | 1 effect lvl at a cost | 1 effect lvls |
|Severe Underdog|3 cons | 3 cons | 2 cons | 1 cons | 1 effect lvl at a cost 
|Impossible| 3 cons | 3 cons |3 cons | 2 cons | 1 cons |
:::

Scale is not just about size, but it's about power.  A cosmic level superhero 
may tear through that imperial dreadnought without slowing down.  In a lot of 
genres size and numbers correlate with power, but not in all genres.

{{Strategy}} is important here.  Tunneling through a mountain with a teaspoon 
is *Impossible*, while following the path around the base of the mountain 
might not even be an obstacle, but both get the Heroes to the other side 
of the mountain.

Taking one or more [consequence level](consequences.md#stress--blood)
generally means the Hero took Stress or Blood depending on 
[Risk](#risk).  Gaining one or more [effect level](resolution.md#effect-levels)
means the Hero overcomes the Challenge or fills a segment
of a [progress clock](../tools/progress.md) and moves
closer toward overcoming a 
complex challenge.  If it comes at a cost, that means that even if successful,
something bad happened in the [narration](narration.md).

### Risk

Almost all challenges have consequences, otherwise they wouldn't be challenges, 
but not all consequences are equal.  

Challenges are *Safe*, *Stressful* or *Bloody*.  

**Safe**:
    : Usually an entire challenge is not safe, but a certain 
    action might be.  A [flashback](../tools/flashbacks.md) or 
    [maneuver](../tools/maneuvers.md) are often safe.
    Safe challenges also might be challenges that aren't dangerous
    themselves, but how much time is taken on them is important.

        Consequences for Safe challenges don't normally inflict stress or blood.
        Effectively the consequences only have a 
        [narrative](narration.md) impact. 
        The Hero's failure to bribe the guard might not have caused any 
        stress, but that guard might recognize the Hero later on. 
    
**Stressful**:
    : This is the default risk for non-violent encounters.  Consequences in 
    these sorts of challenges will usually inflict 
    [Stress](consequences.md#stress--blood) rather than Blood. 
    Both impair the character, but Stress is easier to recover, taking less 
    time than Blood.

        These tend to be social, intellectual and some forms of spiritual
        challenges.  Attempting, and failing, to push your agenda at the 
        Royal Academy only rarely results in blood being spilt, but 
        its damage is just as real.  
        
**Bloody**
    : This is the default risk for violent encounters.  If you take a 
    consequence in this sort of challenge it generally means your clothes
    have holes in them and are stained red with blood.  The Hero will take 
    [Blood](consequences.md#stress--blood) 
    damage which causes the same penalties as Stress, but takes longer
    to recover from.
    
        These challenges are violent or dangerous.  Things like driving 
        the trolls off with violence or defending your honor in a duel 
        with laser pistols are Bloody challenges.
        
Mechanically the only difference is the expected sort of 
[consequences](consequences.md) a Hero will take 
if they fail their Attribute Roll.
