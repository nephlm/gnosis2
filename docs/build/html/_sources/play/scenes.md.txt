# Scenes

Hopefully at this point you have group of Heroes in
situations they simply can’t ignore. The players have
set up a number of scenes by their answers to the
“What just happened?” question. It is time to start
resolving those.

## Scene Framing

n any story or game there are elements that are
interesting and important to the story and there are
things that are tedious and taxes the best table’s ability
to make interesting. Usually it isn’t necessarily about
what is happening, it is about its importance to the
story.

In traditional gaming I’ll give you two examples: The
shopping expedition and travel time. In any game
where stuff is important to a character’s power, the
character’s are going to eventually go shopping. There
is a tendency to follow the character’s in detail and
force something important to happen to make the
scene exciting. This often ends up with the character’s
unable to go anywhere without a carefully calibrated
challenge showing u That is fine when they are
beginners, but when they have world shaking power it
gets kind of silly.

The heart of the problem is that shopping isn’t really
important to the story, it a meta game mechanism for
the player to increase the character’s power. It’s
leveling but it takes time with everyone at the table.

Traveling is the same way. After a certain point,
traveling generally does little to push a personal or
overarching story forward. It’s a necessary descriptive
element connecting meaningful scenes together but
usually isn’t a meaningful scene in itself.

Since time with everyone together around the gaming
table is often a limited commodity, scenes that aren’t
important to someone’s story should be skipped over
with a sentence or paragraph of GM narration.

> “After spending the afternoon shopping you are able
to acquire a sword made by a Dwarven Master.”
“You board the Orient Express in Istanbul and arrive
in Paris late the next day.”

## What Matters?

The character sheet has several features who’s
purpose is to relay to the GM what sort of play the
player is interested in engaging. In a certain sense the
entire sheet is a message to the GM, but certain
features highlight this.

First are the Hero’s Keys. This is how the player has
chosen to be rewarded with Favor, you better believe
he wants scenes about those things. A Hero with the
Key of the Disciple was created by a player who wants
a lot of interaction with his Hero’s Master and wants
play about what it means to be an authentic follower
of the Master’s way.

Just as important are Quest Cards. It is only through
following those quests that the Hero gains power.
Scenes involving or about those quests are what the
player wants to see. He wants to be rewarded with xp
for his Hero, scenes and spotlight time for following
those quests.

Scenes that highlight a Hero’s weakness are just as
important as ones that highlight his strengths. Not
only do they explore the character’s personal story,
but they also invariable get the character into more
trouble. The GM should be pushing these scenes.

Even the character’s Boons and Edges tell you how
the player intends his Hero to overcome challenges
and he wants challenges that can be approached in
that way. A Hero with many persuasion and
diplomacy Boons is run by a player who wants to talk
his way out of tough spots, denying him that is taking
the spotlight away from him which he will eventually
find dissatisfying.

Listen to those character sheets and hit those scenes
where a character’s keys, quests, weakness, Boons and
Edges play center stage.
