# Resolution

By now the player has declared their {{Strategy}} and the GM the 
[Pain Pool](challenge.md#difficulty) or static difficulty as well as 
the 
[Effectiveness](challenge.md#effect) and 
[Risk](challenge.md#risk), so it's time to 
roll some dice.  

This is a standard Attribute Roll which means the character will roll 
dice with the level of advantage on each appropriate to the 
chosen {{Boon}} to use for that attribute and sum the total.

> A Hero trying to sneak into a castle with a 
{{Strategy}} of tier 1 *Broken Window*
for Power, Tier 2 *Light Step* for Precision and Tier 3 *Secret Castle Tunnels*
for Possibility who has D12 for Power, D10 for Precision and D8 for 
Possibility will roll 2D12, 3D10 and 4D8 and sum the highest die of each 
type.  
>
> So if they rolled 8 and 4 on the D12s they would keep the 8. 
If they rolled 2, 9 and 5 on the D10s, they'd keep the 9.
If they rolled 3, 7, 1 and 4 on the D8's they'd keep the 7.
Adding those together their die roll would be 24.

The GM would roll a number of D10s equal to the Pain Pool and 
sum the highest three.

> The Castle has significant security with guard patrols and magical alarms, 
so  the GM is rolling five dice in the Pain Pool.  They roll 4, 10, 8, 7 and 2.
After summing 10, 8 and 7 the Pain Pool totals 25, exceeding the Hero's roll 
by 1. 
>
> Assuming the Castle and the Hero are considered to be of *Similar Power*
for the purpose of sneaking, the Hero does not accomplish their Intent and 
takes one Consequence.

```{admonition} Dominant Narration Theme

Take a note of which pool (including Pain Pool) 
rolled the highest number, this should be used to 
inform the 
[narration](narration.md).  
For example if Power rolled 4, 
Precision rolled 10, Possibility rolled 7 and the highest Pain die rolled 8, 
the Narration will likely be about precision of action, rather 
than one of the other three.

```

## Criticals

By default, if the Hero exceeds the Pain Pool by
{{critical_threshold}} or more they 
achieve a Critical Success.  Likewise, if the Hero rolls 
{{critical_threshold}} below the 
Pain Pool they Critically failed.

The ramifications of criticals vary by effectiveness and 
are outlined in the [Effect table](challenge.md#effect).
Criticals are a lot more common with amateurs flailing around than
two masters dueling.  

The group can increase or decrease
the margin of success needed for a critical 
if the desire is to have more or fewer criticals in the game. 

## Effect Levels

Most Challenges only require a single Effect Level to overcome them, and 
so effect levels are of little consequence, however some Challenges 
are attached to [Progress Clocks](../tools/progress.md), 
and require a certain number of 
Effect Levels to overcome them.

Each Effect Level fills one wedge of the Progress Clock and once the 
Progress Clock is full the Challenge is overcome.
