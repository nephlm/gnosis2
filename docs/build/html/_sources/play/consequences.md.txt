# Stress & Blood

Consequences are a generalized form of harm.  When a Challenge results in 
a Hero taking one or more Consequences it means they have been harmed in 
the attempt.  


Consequences come in two forms: Stress and Blood.  Stress is mental
or psychic trauma, while Blood is physical damage. 

Mechanically, Stress and Blood both have 3 segment progress clocks, 
each time one of the clocks is
filled, the character takes a Wound or a Trauma
depending on which clock was filled and the filled clock is cleared.  

Any partially filled Stress or Blood Progress clocks are cleared at 
the end of the scene, while any actual points of Stress and Blood will
remain until recovered. 


## Wounds and Trauma

Each Wound and Trauma add a level of {{disadvantage}} to each
Attribute Role.  Blood and Trauma stack, so a Hero with 
one Wound and one Trauma would have two levels of disadvantage.

Disadvantage counters advantage on a one-for-one basis. 
A level of Disadvantage  applies to the attribute 
with the greatest level of advantage first. 
In the case of multiple Attributes with the same level 
of advantage, the player chooses which Attribute the 
Disadvantage applies to.

In the case where there are no advantage dice to counter, 
the player rolls an additional die, and chooses the lowest
number instead of the highest.  Each additional level of 
disadvantage adds another die the, still choosing the lowest
roll.

## Taken Out

A player can choose to have their Hero taken out at any time.  
If a player makes that choice at end of hte challenge, they
are allowed to make two [](#first-aid) rolls, instead of the 
normal one. 

If at any point a Hero attempts to make an Attribute Roll while 
all attributes are at Disadvantage, they are taken out.

A Hero that is taken out is *not* dead unless that is the outcome
the player chooses.  

They are in trouble and likely need the help of their comrades to 
get out of their current predicament. 

The narrative effect of being taken out will depend on the situation
and whether the challenge was eventually overcome by the Hero's 
comrades or if the Hero is at the mercy of whatever took them out.

## First Aid

At the end of any scene a Hero took Wounds or Traumas the 
Hero may make a recovery roll to immediately treat the 
Wounds or Trauma.

A separate roll is made for Wounds and Trauma.  
The {{disadvantage}} levels applied by the Wounds and Trauma apply 
to this roll, but this roll is considered safe.

| Type | Recovery Difficulty |
| :-: | :-: |
| Stress | 16 |
| Wounds | 20 |

The Trauma recovery roll has a difficulty of 16 and is an 
Attribute Roll.  Any appropriate {{Boons}} can be added to this
roll as per normal.

The Wound recovery roll has a difficulty of 20 and is 
also an Attribute Roll made with any appropriate {{Boons}}.
The {{Strategy}} to recover from Stress and Wounds will almost 
always be different.

Each Effect Level removes one Trauma or Wound as appropriate to the roll
being made. 
A post incident recovery roll can't recover more Trauma or Wounds
than the Hero took in the incident they are recovering from.

## Rest, Relaxation and Medical Care

If during the narrative there comes a moment where the Hero does 
something to get an opportunity to recover they will be able to 
make another recovery roll.

| Event | Recovery Type |
| - | :-: |
| Sleep | Both |
| Visit medical professional | Wounds |
| Visit a mental health professional | Trauma |
| Spend time socializing in a safe space | Trauma |
| Engage is emotional self-care | Trauma |
| Engage with an unhealthy coping vice | Trauma |
| Something character specific | Trauma |

This roll works the same as [](#first-aid) except it can remove 
Wounds or Trauma that weren't recently acquired.

Different Heroes have different methods of dealing with Trauma, 
so if it seems the Hero is engaging with their personalized method 
of handling trauma, they should be able to make a Trauma recovery roll.

Wounds generally require rest, magic or at least a medical amateur.
